<p>Henry Ward Beecher, in a sermon shortly before his death,
said America was going through a period of disgrace. This was
true; for there had come to pass, what the prophetic Lincoln
had foretold, that, as the result of the war, monopolies had been
enthroned, that had filled the land with corruption and imperilled
the liberties of the people.</p>

<p>To-day the period of disgrace is worse than then, for the
corrupt tree which was then bearing so luxuriant a crop has
had several years more in which to develop its fruit-bearing
capacity.</p>

<p>On every hand Mammon reigns. His throne has been set up in the very
place of sovereignty. His rule is universal and absolute. The price of
his favor is the sacrifice of all truth, virtue and honor. Honest, hard
work has become the synonym of poverty; and it has become the fixed rule
of our civilization&mdash;a rule with absolutely no exception&mdash;that
no one can come to great wealth except by some of the many forms of
legal stealing. At his feet all organized institutions bow and worship.
Politics are corrupt to the core. Our legislatures&mdash;as Beecher used
to declare of that of New York&mdash;are everywhere the shambles where
legislators are bought and sold like sheep. Political “bosses” possess,
and lord it over, the souls and bodies of the chattel voters of the
“parties” with as brutal a despotism as ever Czar or Kaiser wielded.
Legislation-favored monopolists of the various means of the people’s
“life, liberty and the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span>

pursuit of happiness” are openly and commonly termed “Kings,”
“Lords,” “Barons,” as though in undisguised contempt of the
thinly veiled pretense that this is a republic.</p>

<p>To-day is fulfilled that which thirty-six years ago was prophesied
by Lord Macauley, that, America’s public lands being all
gone, England’s poverty would be reproduced in our cities. It
is literally true as he foretold, that in Chicago there is a
multitude of people none of whom has had more than half a
breakfast, or expects to have more than half a dinner.</p>

<p>Our daily crop of common theft, murder, suicide and insanity
is probably greater than that of any other country; while the
crop of respectable, pious and educated scoundrelism, embezzlement,
fraud and crime was probably never paralleled in the
worst days of the worst monarchy that ever existed, for the
thousands of our daily newspapers the country over have little
else than the records of the universally abounding venality,
corruption and wickedness with which to fill their columns.</p>

<p>Business, trade and commerce are nothing less than a chaos
of clashing, discordant self-interests; a universal war; a pandemonium
of noisy lying, overreaching, cheating and stealing.</p>

<p>Patriotism, too&mdash;especially with our so called upper classes&mdash;has
become almost universally a “livery of Heaven to serve the
devil in,” and is the particular characteristic of the hypocritical
scoundrels whose whole business in life it has been to trade on
the necessities of the Government, and to make money out of
the wholesale theft of the public domain, the sale of the liberties
of the people, and the bonding and mortgaging of the future
products of their labor&mdash;even unto those of the grandchildren of
generations yet unborn&mdash;to the leeches and loafing non-producers

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3-4]</span>

of every foreign country. The land is full of such worse than
Benedict Arnolds. Blatant hypocrites they are, who&mdash;Judas-like&mdash;ostentatiously
kiss the Flag and worship the republic to-day,
but are ready at any convenient moment to haul down the
one and overthrow the other for an extra five per cent. dividend
on the bondage of the people.</p>

<p>The Church, as always, is the willing handmaid of the oppressor
everywhere; and to suit the wealthy lords who are her
chief support, preaches a Mammonized God and an insipid,
harmless, garbled and un-Christlike Christ; and in all her wide
domain, has no real hope or help for the groaning millions but
a shadowy future world.</p>

<p>For this universal degeneracy the people themselves are
wholly to blame. Was it not Montesquieu who said “all governments
are as bad as the people will let them be?” They are
the masters whensoever they will so to be. But they do not
will, because they are ignorant and asleep. When they shall
awake and come to a knowledge of their wrongs, they will have
but to command through the ballot box, and they shall cease.</p>

<p>We need a new race of Whittiers, Lowells, Phillipses, Lincolns
and Garrisons to arouse the people from their lethargy and
inspire them to take back their stolen heritage of rights, before
their one last peaceful remedy, the ballot, shall be stolen away
too.</p>

<p>To help open their eyes, and help on that blessed time when
this shall really be a government of the people, by the people,
and for the people, this little book was written.</p>

</div>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>THERE was once a time
when dogs <i>were</i> dogs
and dwelt together respectably
in the respectable
town of Canisville. Canisville
was situated on the west
side of a big fish pond, from the
east side of which the forefathers
and foremothers of the dogs had come, driven out by the
dogs of Kyhidom, the great city of those parts, because they
had dared to say many most grievous things about the folly of
dogs allowing fleas to settle on them, to boss them and suck
their blood.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>For be it known, the dogs of Kyhidom were great idolaters
with very small heads, who had been easily taught to reverence
and worship fleas in general, and their own in particular, as
having been ordained of God to suck their blood; and when
these rebel dogs with preposterous, new fangled notions about
the rights of dogs, got loud-mouthed in their remarks, the good,
orthodox, divine-right-of-fleas dogs were scandalized and said
that the rebel dogs were committing the sin of doubting the
wisdom of things that were and had been, and were flying in
the face of Providence; and as they were there to protect Providence
at all hazards, those dogs must either cease flying in the
face of Providence or fly from the country. So the rebel dogs,
not being able to stop flying in the face of Providence aforesaid,
did fly from the country and paddled their own canoe to
the other side of the pond, where they founded the new town
of Canisville.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this same Providence, who, on that side of the
pond, apparently could not bear to have his face flown in, did
seem to mightily bless and prosper them on this side thereof; and
they became a well-to-do community and were guided, ruled and
advised by a wise and venerable patriarchal chief of the name
of Bull McMastiff, who taught them various wise maxims
and laws. Every morning he would call them to a conversazione,
and after admonishing them of their sins, faults, mistakes
and transgressions of the day before, would advise them
of the way wherein they should trot to-day; and he always dismissed
them with this particular bit of advice: “My children,
your enemy the flea goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking
whom he may devour. He loveth dogs, and neglecteth no opportunity
to take possession of one, particularly the lazy one.
But remember, I pray ye, your forefathers and foremothers;
how they refused to hump the back for fleas to ride upon; how
they gat themselves up out of Kyhidom, out of the House of
Bondage, and came into this land flowing with milk and honey,
where ye have grown to be a mighty, prosperous and free people

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>

undevoured of fleas. Therefore I say unto you, be vigilant,
and diligently beware of the flea.”</p>

<p>And so it was that while they continued to hearken unto the
barks of the good chief McMastiff, they dwelt in safety and put
away from amongst them all those who had the itch and the
mange and the scab and the botch.</p>

<p>And they searched diligently all through the camp, and
whomsoever they found scratching with the hind leg, or viciously
biting himself, they incontinently hauled up before the
judge and made confess where he had caught his flea, or rather
where his flea had caught him; and when they had taken the
flea and caused it to be put to death, they sentenced the culprit
to be cleansed every day for a month; but if the offender
offended again, they worried him to death and cast out his carcass.</p>

<p>NOW all the inhabitants of Canisville walked righteously
all the days of Bull McMastiff, and the
blessing of Heaven was upon them. They kept
his statutes and judgments and laid up his commandments
in their hearts, and were blessed in
their uprising, and their downsitting, in their
going out, and in their coming in. Plenty
crowned their years, and full were always their
basket and their store; their bread was certain and their water
sure; peace and everlasting joy were in all their borders, and
want and poverty and plague were far away and unknown, save
as by stories of travelers in strange and heathen lands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>But it came to pass that Bull McMastiff died and was gathered
to his fathers, full of days, full of honors, and toothless, and
Pup McPoodle reigned in his stead. And Pup McPoodle did
evil in the sight of all the community, and walked not in the
ways of Bull McMastiff. In the cussedness of his heart, he
caused the whole community of dogs to turn aside from following
the wise maxims and counsels of Bull McMastiff, in keeping
of which they had grown fat and strong and sleek and
well-to-do. He scoffed when certain good old conservative
canines reminded him of McMastiff’s vigilant care of the community,
and when they quoted his maxims, he barked and
said “Rats.”</p>

<p>And the canines turned aside from following Bull McMastiff.
And it came to pass that they neglected to haul up for punishment
those who scratched with the hind leg; and soon it was
found that many were with flea.</p>

<p>In those days other trouble fell on the inhabitants of Canisville;
for the fleas of Kyhidom, who had ordered the dogs of
Kyhidom to drive out the rebellious dogs that flew in the face
of Providence, felt the loss of the driven-out dogs; and although
they hated much their heretic doctrines, they hated more to
lose the tribute of blood they had been accustomed to get out of
them. So they sent some delegate fleas over the pond to beg of
the outlawed and exiled dogs, to be good enough not to forget
the fleas of their own beloved native land, but to send over at
stated times a little of their blood to keep them from starving.
And the delegates pleaded so hard in the names of religion,
patriotism, the old country, the old ties of blood, and for old
acquaintance’ sake that the exiled dogs relented and repented,
and consented to bleed themselves so much a month and send
the blood over in a bowl for the sustenance of the Kyhidom fleas,
who were content to receive it thus, although they grumbled at
the quantity which they said ought to have been at least two
bowlfuls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="Illustration: THEY SENT SOME DELEGATE FLEAS OVER THE POND." width="600" height="378" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>In process of time, however, when the fleas of Kyhidom had
grown accustomed to receiving regularly the monthly bowlful,
and the dogs of Canisville had become accustomed to being
bled, the appetite of the fleas began to grow, and they grew
fretful and began to say that the dogs over the pond were growing
mean and unmindful of the duty they owed to their
mother country.</p>

<p>So they sent over another delegation to tell the dogs of Canisville
that the appetite of the fleas of Kyhidom had very much improved, and
that it was very necessary unto their health that the dogs send over a
double tribute of blood, and that in case of refusal the fleas would
feel very much hurt in their feelings; and above all, that the refusal
would be very displeasing to Gorgeous Littlehead Flea, the King of
Kyhidom, who was the especial friend and protector of fleas; in fact,
so dearly and devotedly did he love them that they were to him as the
apples of his eyes, and any insult to them he would regard as tantamount
to treason against <i>him</i>. But the dogs made reply that they could not
conscientiously comply with the new request; that they themselves were
not doing as well as formerly; that they had fleas of their own to
support now, and that really, while holding the very highest regard and
reverence for the fleas of their beloved old Kyhidom (having forgiven
the outrage perpetrated there upon their forefathers), they hoped the
fleas would kindly excuse any additional contribution, and try to rest
content with the usual monthly bowlful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="Illustration: BE VERY DISPLEASING TO GORGEOUS LITTLEHEAD FLEA, THE KING OF KYHIDOM." width="377" height="450" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Certain of the dogs, however, who were known as “Advanced,”
very disrespectfully spoke up and said that this sending of
blood away over the pond was all wrong; it was contrary to
sound sense, and was detrimental to the interests of the community
to send blood away to fleas that didn’t live in the country;
that this was “Absenteeism” and absenteeism was the ruin

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>

of any country; that the first duty of dogs was to their own
native fleas and not to foreigners, and that their advice was to
refuse to send any more blood over the pond, and to drive the
whole pesky lot of foreign fleas out of the land.</p>

<p>And all the native fleas cried out that that was well spoken,
and displayed the true Spirit of Independence. And they violently
urged all the other dogs to take up that Spirit and make
a firm and decided Stand for Liberty, and refuse to send any
more blood over the pond to the Kyhidom fleas, but to <i>remember
their own</i> who were brought up with them, and were <i>blood
of their blood</i>. And it was so that these words prevailed, and
the Canisville dogs did refuse to send any more blood.</p>

<p>So the Kyhidom fleas went home and reported the gross insult
and grievous injury they had received, which moved the
whole of Kyhidom to anger; and the fleas told the dogs of the
insolence and wickedness of their cousins beyond the pond;
and the dogs were even more angry than the fleas, for they had
been for many generations schooled and drilled by the fleas in
the sound and profitable (to the fleas) doctrine that an injury to
one flea is the concern of all dogs.</p>

<p>Therefore the dogs got on their Dignity&mdash;which was all in
their hind legs&mdash;and cried aloud that the National Honor had
been insulted, and the National Flag had been dirtied, and the
face of Providence had been flown in, and His Majesty, King
Gorgeous Littlehead Flea, had been treasoned against; and some
fleas cried “Down with the Canisvillians,” which cry was taken
up by the dogs, who howled “Down with the Canisvillians,”
until they were hoarse, though who the Canisvillians were and
where they dwelt, few of the dogs knew, and what they had
done still fewer had any idea; but all knew it felt good to shout,
and was, withal, well pleasing to the fleas. So they all ran and
asked the fleas to lend them files to sharpen their teeth and
claws with, and demanded that the fleas pick out the most valiant
dogs to lead them across the pond, that they might tear
out the eyes and bowels of the vile Canisville dogs, who had

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>

dared to insult and rob their dearly beloved fleas, and treason
against His Superbly Serene and Supersacred Majesty, Gorgeous
Littlehead Flea, by the Grace of God King of Kyhidom and
defender of All Wrong and Bad Faith.</p>

<p>And the fleas said the conduct and high spirit of the dogs
were exceedingly commendable and showed the highest Patriotism.
And they gave sanction for the dogs to sharpen their
teeth and claws, and to go over the pond to tear out the eyes
and bowels of the Canisville dogs. The fleas, moreover, said
thus unto them: “Good dogs; brave dogs; it is a grand and
glorious thing to fight and die for our Hearths and Homes, as
ye are about to go and do by ripping up those of the dogs beyond
the water; it is meet that ye take our National Honor and
our National Flag and go wash out their stains in the blood of
their insulters, as your forefathers and foregrandfathers have
done thousands of times before. Bear with you and ever jealously
guard those sacred Junk, for it takes so very, very little to
dirty them, and so very, very much blood to cleanse them. Ours
is a Just Cause and will command the blessing of Heaven, which
has never failed to bless the strong claws and teeth of the dogs
of Kyhidom, to the discomfiture of weaker dogs. But, dear
dogs, we must ALL do our duty; an occasion like the present
calls for <i>sacrifice</i> from <i>every one</i>. In this solemn hour, and face to
face with DUTY, let <i>no one</i> shirk to do his uttermost share in aid
of the Common Cause. In this solemn Crisis, we cannot <i>all</i> go to
the field; some <i>must</i> remain at home; but whether we go to
the field or remain at home, each can nobly bear his part. We
are not equally gifted; some have the teeth and the claws, and
some have the Means; we need both equally; the Means without
the teeth and claws, is utterly useless, the teeth and claws
without the Means can do but little, but with both united and
the Blessing of God, all things are possible. <i>We</i> have the
Means and <i>you</i> have the teeth and claws; let us then, with an
eye single to the glory of Our Common Country, join our gifts
in a Common Sacrifice and lay them both on our Country’s

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>

Altar; ye shall, with your teeth and claws, go to the fight, and
we will stay home and find the Means to send you and maintain
you in the fight; and ye can repay us when ye come back;
but if ye come not back, why then, your children, and your children’s
children can repay us. We will not be hard upon you,
we will Loan the Means, we will Advance it, and we will call
it your DEBT which ye may owe forever and ever, provided
ye or your children pay us a little for it every year.</p>

<p>“Then go to the war, good dogs, and the Lord be with you,
and we will stay home with the Lord and Manage the country
for you.”</p>

<p>And all the dogs gnashed their newly sharpened teeth and
howled again, “Down with the Canisvillians,” “God save our
Noble Fleas,” and “Long live King Gorgeous Littlehead Flea.”</p>

<p>But when they arrived in the land of the Canisvillians, and
proceeded, with the Blessing of God, to tear out their eyes and
their bowels, those Canisville dogs also showed surprisingly
large teeth and dreadfully sharp and strong claws; whereupon
the blessing of God did go over to their side, and they did
amazingly wallop the life out of the Kyhidom dogs, insomuch
that all that were not dead ran howling down to the pond and
swam away home, and did no more venture to come back.</p>

<p>Then did the dogs of Canisville feel highly elated at having
walloped the dogs of Kyhidom, and kept on barking and barking about
their victory, and saying they could do it again, and they wished some
of those Kyhis would come back again to be walloped. All which great
joy and elation their own native fleas, being fleas of subtlety, did
turn to their own profit; for they, seeing that dogs always like to be
pushed in the way they want to go, ordained certain Remembrance Days to
be observed through all the land, on which days the dogs should have
flattering looking glasses held up to them, should be sung to and made
poetry to, and orated at, and have incense burned for the gratification
of their nostrils. There was “Defiance to Kyhidom Day,” and “The Awful
Walloping Day,” and “Kyhi

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>

Skedaddle Day,” and “Get-Along-all-by-Ourselves Day,” and
“Slain Dogs Day” and a host of other Days on which the
dogs told one another and the fleas told them what grand,
noble and gloriously independent dogs they were, that would
never, no never, endure the tyrant on their soil, or suffer any
bobtailed, measly, foreign dog to boss it over them.</p>

<p>And it was so that they grew so ineffably conceited and vain,
by reason of eternally Remembering themselves and admiring
their own features, that they quite forgot the fleas on their own
backs. So the fleas had good fat times and were little disturbed;
and in the inmost sanctuary of their own private gatherings
they did knowingly wink the eye and say that for enabling
dogs to Forget their own Rights the Remembrance Days beat
all Creation.</p>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>NOW the poor fool dogs of Canisville had been told by their own fleas
that victory over the wicked dogs of Kyhidom meant Freedom, Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity, Prosperity, Universal Wealth, Heaven, to
themselves; and they believed them. But it did not. On the contrary,
Freedom, Liberty, Equality, etc., etc., gradually vanished like a
setting sun, and a great plague of itch, came upon all the dogs; and
from the rising of the sun until the going down thereof, and until his
rising again, the dogs scratched and scratched and abraded themselves
against walls and posts, and howled and barked and barked and barked
about the “Good old times” when all dogs were healthy and lustrous of
coat.</p>

<p>And the dogs grew thin and lank and mangy looking. Their
eyes grew lustreless, and their ribs could be counted by the
naked eye at quite a distance. Their ears hung down; their
spirit departed; and only when some specially venomous flea
gave a dog a specially venomous nip did he awake from his
listlessness; with a quick explosive yelp he would suddenly
flop on the ground and cause his hind leg to vibrate with the
rapidity of a suddenly released spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>But as for the fleas they prospered in an inverse ratio to the
dogs. All the qualities of the dogs seemed to be transferred to
them. As the dogs grew thin the fleas grew fat and plump.
As the dogs grew listless the fleas grew lively. As a total
aggregate of dog and flea there seemed to be no loss of volume;
for what one lost the other seemed to gain. The average of
blood, vitality and energy seemed about as before; and to the
outside spectator, it made no difference; but it was another
matter entirely with the constituent parts; for the only part of
this society that was abundantly satisfied was the fleas, and the
only part that was not at all satisfied was the dogs.</p>

</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>And it came to pass that the dogs became possessed, seemingly,
of a desire to work harder. Everyone now frenziedly tore
around, scratching in gutters for any kind of dirty eatables,
nosing in garbage barrels and keeping up an incessant trot in
search of something to eat. Moreover they seemed to become
possessed of the devil. Their tempers went sour, and they seemed
to be perpetually on the hunt for a fight. Let but one dog
be found munching a bone, and instantly half-a-dozen others,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>

with growls, would rush upon him and compel him to let go,
only to snarl, and rage and battle for it amongst themselves;
from which conflict several would emerge bleeding, torn and
ragged. And the more they fought and squabbled for bones
and scraps, the scarcer the bones and scraps seemed to grow.
The dogs were always hungry, and in spite of their utmost
efforts many fell by the wayside and died of starvation; and the
wail of the hungry ones nightly went up to heaven.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_020.jpg" alt="Illustration: POSSESED OF EVIL." width="391" height="500" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Why was all this? Nobody seemed to know, save a few old
fogy dogs who remembered the good time of the reign of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>

departed chieftain, Bull McMastiff. <i>They</i> said that there were
as many bones and scraps in the community as ever there were;
yea, that there were more than ten times as many as in McMastiff’s
reign. <i>They</i> said that the real reason was that every dog
had become so thickly settled with fleas, that, no matter how
hard and how many hours a day he hunted for food, he could
never get enough to nourish himself, because the fleas he carried
<i>ate him up</i> and so continually sucked his blood, that they kept
him always thin and on the very edge of starvation. Said they:
“Behold the fleas; they toil not, neither do they spin, neither
do they hunt after bones, nor do any manner of work on the
Sabbath, nor on any other day, for a living; and yet, verily, not
a dog in all his plumpness in the good old times, was half so
plump as one of these. Behold how easy be the times these
suckers have; the body which maintains them carries them
around, and is, in all respects, their most humble and obedient
servant.”</p>

</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>But the bare-ribbed, hungry and flea-ridden mob of dogs
derided these wise old stagers and mockingly cried out to them,
“Go up, ye bald heads; what do ye know about these things?”
“Shut up your jaw!” “Pull down your vest!” “Shoot them

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>

teeth!” and other such ribald remarks. Therefore the wise
old dogs did shut up, and did no more try the impossible job of
teaching fools. And in a few more years they drew up their
feet and gave up the ghost; and the community had rest from
their unwelcome prophesying.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<img src="images/i_022.jpg" alt="Illustration: THE CORONER’S INQUEST." width="500" height="408" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>But <i>the miseries of the dogs did not abate with the death of
those who told them what the matter was</i>. Every day the police
dogs reported that they had discovered another one either dying
or dead of starvation; and then the dogs ran together and called
a confab, which they named an “inquest.” And the “inquest”
was a solemn ceremony where a dozen or more dogs, each blind
in one eye, headed by another dog called a “Coroner”&mdash;also
blind in one eye and weak in the other&mdash;looked the dead dog all
over and then said:   “Natural causes;” “Visitation of God;”
“An&aelig;mia;” “Atrophy;” “Cardialgia;” “<i>Vacuity of the</i>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>

<i>Alimentary Canal</i>,” and then ordered somebody to bury him in
the sacred place of dogs called the “Field of the Potter.”</p>

<p>But it was several times noticed that no “inquest” was ever
held over a flea. When a flea died he was always in bed, surrounded
by a coming and going host of his sorrowing pulician
friends, and attended by a peculiar set of creatures called
“Emdees.” who did all they could to retard his death. And
when he was dead they all signed an elaborately ornamented
paper called a “certificate,” which set forth that the “late
lamented” sucker had “deceased” and “passed away” and
“gone to Heaven” by reason of the highly respectable complaint
known as “Abnormal Enlargement of the Paunch,” and
recommended him to the gracious notice and distinguished consideration
of the angels.</p>

</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>THINGS went from bad to worse among the dogs. It became the universal
thing for dogs to be hungry and coatless and to go about weary, languid
and sore distressed.</p>

<p>But what was worst of all, there was arising in the community
a sentiment that for dogs to be hungry, coatless, weary, languid
and sore distressed was the natural and normal condition; that
this condition was ordained and fixed by some higher power
against which it was blasphemy to contend or even to murmur.
Yea, one poor fool of a dog, who said he had been to a place
called a “Church,” where the fleas got together one day in
every seven to hear a renegade dog bark to them for a good
basketful of meat, got up and told them that he had seen the
said barking dog, whose name he thought, if he remembered
rightly, was Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite, turn over the
leaves of some big book or other that lay on a costly cushion,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>

and then tell the fleas, in a very loud voice, that inside that big
book it was written, in big letters, that some very great person,
called Jesus, or some such name, did in a far-away country, a
very many hundreds of years ago, once say to some friends of his
“the poor ye have always with you,” and that that meant that
it was and always would be God’s will that dogs should be poor,
and lank, and hungry, and covered with fleas. And he said
that it was the evident design of God himself that dogs were
created expressly for the purpose of carrying and nourishing
fleas. That God, who had done all things well, had seen fit in
his wisdom to create for his own glory both dogs <i>and</i> fleas, in
order that the fleas, having sucked nearly all the blood out of
the dogs, might show their “Charity” in giving back to them a
few drops now and then.</p>

<p>And he told them a most beautiful and touching story of how
one Andronicus Carnivorous, a certain well-known sucker, who,
originally, came over the pond from North Kyhidom and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>

settled amongst them, had grown monstrously big and strong
on the blood of poor dogs, after having sucked some scores of
millions of drops out of thousands of them, had on a certain day
before high heaven and the assembled priesthood, and with the
burning of incense and the applause of a great mob whose voice
was as the sound of many waters, most generously and magnificently
given fifty thousand drops back again to be distributed
by a committee of lady fleas, amongst the “most worthy and
deserving poor,” and five hundred thousand drops more to the
“Church” to be expended on a new organ, a new, big, golden
cross on top of the steeple, and some windows of stained glass,
and a big brass plate in the most prominent part of the
“Church” stating for all posterity, the name of the great
sucker who gave it. All of which showed that the said eminent
sucker, although he did not, alas, and unfortunately,
believe in the God of the fleas, was a most pious saint, who
humbly regarded his great wealth as a trust, and was endeavoring
to give a good account of his stewardship.</p>

<p>And he told them what a great and brilliant light this Saint
Andronicus had shed over all the town and country of the
Canisvillians, and how, by his illustrious example he had shown
the only true and honorable way of getting up from nothing to
the highest pinnacle of wealthy comfort&mdash;which was by “organizing”
great bodies of dogs to build him a high pyramid of dying
dogs for him to climb up and feed on as he climbed; how
by his enormous diligence and ability in “acquiring” he had
come to own many mansions and palaces here below; how by
strict methodical habits and careful husbanding of time he had
been able to snatch a few moments from his arduous duties of
trotting around from mansion and palace to palace and mansion
enjoying himself, to write beautiful sermons on the true way of
distributing the results of dog phlebotomy&mdash;it was, he said, to
take the blood of the dogs he had exhausted, and carry it many
miles away (from three to ten thousand) and there pour it out
into a long trough, and whistle to any and all dogs living thereabouts

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>

to come, without money and without price and lap it up.
“Thus,” said he, “do I fulfill the great Natural Law of the
Circulation of the Blood; the dogs who yield it see it no more,
and strange dogs who yield it not get it all&mdash;save the tribute I
take from it for the maintenance of me and mine. Thus do I
make brethren of all the world of dogs and all is well, and Saint
Andronicus is glorified.”</p>

<p>He had also so far descended from his high glory as to write
by proxy a beautiful book of trashy platitudes, entitled “Triumphant
Dogocracy” which set forth and proved that the dogs
of Canisville were the fattest, freest, happiest and most prosperous
dogs in all the world, and that their fatness, freedom and
prosperity were all owing to the fact that, since the driving out
of the dogs of Kyhidom and the abolition of the sending of
blood over the pond to nourish the Absentee Fleas, and the
destruction of the system of <i>not allowing dogs to consent</i> to being
bled by the fleas, they had established the self governing
system of <i>permitting them to consent</i>, and allowing the fleas to
go over the pond and take the dogs’ blood with them. All
which demonstrated the glorious advantage of having abolished
the system of Tweedledum and of having established that of
Tweedledee.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the said most estimable Andronicus had been unfortunately
compelled to allow sundry of his own dogs to receive
fatherly chastisement because they had become restive under
several extra bites he had proposed to give them for their good.</p>

<p>And the barking dog in peroration said, “Whom the Lord
loveth he chasteneth; even so hath Saint Andronicus done unto
those he loved, that they may not again err from the path of duty.”</p>

<p>And all the little dogs, who sat on the “free seats” all around
the “Church,” wagged their little tails and barked pleasantly;
and all the assembled fleas stroked their fat paunches contentedly,
and said that they had heard that morning a most
powerful gospel sermon, and that their salaried barker was a
true prophet of God.</p>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>AT last it came to pass by reason of having forgotten that there
ever had been better days than they now saw that the dogs grew to
believe that the state of things they lived under was the only true and
natural one. True, they grew bad tempered and fierce and bit and tore
one another in their daily “Battle of Life.” True, every dog tried to
snatch the meat out of every other dog’s mouth, and true, many a dog
was murdered for the sake of any scrap of food he had succeeded in
“saving up” and had “put by for a rainy day.” True, canine society had
become a hell upon earth, where every dog took for his motto, “Every
dog for himself, and the devil take the hindmost,” but not one among
them ever dreamed of doubting that their state was according to natural

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>

pre-ordination. Thus they came to regard the rule of strength, craft,
cunning and good luck as the proper one, because the only one; and to
this they squared their lives and their philosophy.</p>

<p>Their chief, Pup McPoodle, “stood in” with the fleas, and on
condition that his own body should be free, he undertook to use
his power as chief to make it easier for them to suck the blood
of the rest of the community. He walked in more evil ways
than any evil dog that ever reigned before him. He revived all
the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord cast out, and
burnt incense unto strange gods and worshipped devils, and being
tempted of these, he called a council of the hungriest and
thirstiest of the fleas, and they did devise and invent a wicked
instrument of torture called a “Protectivtarif.” It was a machine
having a nice bed on which a dog was laid, and an upper
portion called a “dooty” which was worked with a long handle
called a “government,” which was invisible to all but the
operators, but which when properly operated brought down the
“dooty” upon the dog with variously regulated degrees of
squeeze and crush, ranging from twenty-five to one hundred
and fifty pounds per square inch, and which caused the dog to
howl and his blood to squirt out far more rapidly than the
fleas could extract it by ordinary suction.</p>

<p>But over the use of this instrument the fleas got to disagreement
and bickering. For there were those who said that the
higher pressures were destructive of profit to the fleas, as they
nearly killed the dog and prevented him making new blood;
that the lower pressures alone were profitable economically.
But the others said, “No, the higher the pressure the better for
the dog;” for they had invented a Rule-of-Contrary Magnifying
Glass that had a most astonishing property, when looked
through, of making a dog appear bigger and plumper and more
prosperous, the more he was flattened out. Argufy as they
might, the Low Pressure fleas could not get the High Pressure
fleas to look at the squeezed dogs with the naked eye.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>

For answer the High Pressurists rolled up their eyes most
piously and said that the invention of the Glass was the Gift of
God, sent down from Heaven to look at dogs with, and it would
never do to despise the Gift by blasphemously doing without it,
and looking at facts with sinful natural eyes. And the High
Pressurists did prevail in argument, for they were more powerful
than the Low Pressurists, and kept up the high pressure against
the protests of the Low Pressurists, so that many dogs had the
ghost squeezed out of them and died.</p>

<p>And then with the help of this instrument the fleas went off
and invented another called a “Trust,” the wickedness of which
can only be fully expressed in Satanese. And other base dogs
seeing that the only way to get freedom themselves was to help
the fleas to suck the rest, went and licked the feet of McPoodle,
and became his courtiers and aided and abetted him in bringing
their fellow dogs under the power of the fleas.</p>

<p>Then did some of the biggest and fattest of the fleas gather
themselves together, and put their wits together to devise a
most wondrous scheme of prosperity to themselves. Said they,
“Lo! These dogs be jackasses most foolish. They act not together,
neither bark they in unison. Though they be exceeding
strong and we be but weak, <i>we can do just as we please
with them</i>, for we have wit and they have strength which <i>they
know not how to use</i>. We will put on them therefore ‘as
much as they will bear.’ We know how far we dare go; and
if any out-of-date fool, with such a piece of antiquated old furniture
as a heart within him, shall dare to remonstrate with us
we will say, ‘The dogs be damned.’”</p>

<p>And it was so that they ordered McPoodle to order his slaves
to build them a big Mill with a great, wide, deep hopper to it,
which Mill was turned with a long Handle that went exceedingly
hard and creaky for want of oil. And McPoodle set a lot
of his courtier and lickspittle dogs called “Chuckers-in” to
catch and chuck other dogs into the hopper; and got a lot of
very hungry dogs for a promise of reward to turn the Handle

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>

so that the poor dogs thrown in were ground up body and
bones, and their blood ran out by a big Spout into a big Tank
below, around which sat a large company of big fleas&mdash;who
called themselves “The Brethren,” chief of whom was Andronicus
Carnivorous&mdash;drinking blood by wholesale; a method which
they said was a great improvement over the slow one of boring
for it with the old-fashioned stiletto, and raising it with the
suction pump, and was much less laborious and more reliable.</p>

<p>This blood was of a very peculiar appearance, for its corpuscles
were very large and quite visible to the naked eye. They were
disk shaped, and when held up to the light showed most singular
markings on both sides. On one side there seemed to be the
figure of a head and bust of a female of the human species, having
on a ridiculous looking night cap, on which was the word
“Liberty,” and on the other side of the disk were some words
that the learned said were “In God we Trust,” the meaning of
which nobody was able to make out. How the corpuscles came
to have those strange markings nobody knew, but a few of
the more daring hazarded the conjecture that they were due to
a surviving taint in the blood of some old time religion that had
gone out of fashion and been forgotten. But the greedy drinkers
of the blood said these peculiarities did not at all derogate from
the goodness of the flavor of it.</p>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>NOW the dogs did grind and sweat eighteen
hours a day at the Mill, and the fleas around the Tank at the
bottom had high old times, and said that the lines had fallen
unto them in pleasant places and they had a goodly heritage.
But they were very considerate of the dogs at the Handle, and
to reward them for their grinding, did smear a little spoon quite
liberally with the Blood in the Tank, and did send up the spoon
for them to lick, but with strict injunctions that they were to
regard the gift as something to be thankful for, in that Capital

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>

had condescended to set up a Mill in their midst and had vouchsafed
to give them employment at the Handle thereof; and they
added the further injunction that they were not to stop turning
the Handle, but to lick the spoon as they turned.</p>

<p>But the dogs did frequently grow weary, and often one would
fall down fainting: whereupon the fleas ordered the chuckers-in
to chuck him into the hopper and run for another to take his
place at the Handle, which caused the other Handle turners to
turn with double diligence, in the deadly fear of being thrown
in themselves. But the fleas who sat below and drank the
Blood grew bigger and bigger and bigger, until they were all
paunch; so big and fat and full did they become that their skins
glistened with very tightness; and had some one pricked them
with a pin, they would have exploded with a loud report. But
the fuller and tighter they grew the more savagely and ferociously
hungry did they grow; and when the dogs grew weary
at the Handle and the Stream of Blood slowed down slightly,
they sent up fierce messages to them wanting to know why the
Satan they didn’t turn, and what in the Everlasting Profundo
they meant by it, and did they not know that they were cheating
and robbing their masters; and what were dogs coming to
nowadays, anyway?</p>

<p>To all of which deep conundrums the dogs could find no
answer but to wake up and grind with hysteric fury; and the
more furious grinding gave a temporarily thicker stream of
Blood below, which only whetted the appetite of the fleas, so
that the thicker Stream had then to be kept up, otherwise the
fleas did send up the savage conundrums to the dogs at the
Handle.</p>

<p>At last, however, the dogs became so faint with the unrequited
turning that the Stream very greatly slowed down, which very
greatly quickened up the anger of the Brethren, who not only
sent up doubly savage conundrums, but an announcement that
they were losing terribly in their income; that instead of being
very full and very tight, they were merely full, and were going

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>

rapidly down hill to bankruptcy and ruin; and that they really,
out of simple justice to themselves, could not afford to smear
the little spoon so liberally; but would be compelled in future
to smear it according to an instrument called a “Sliding Scale
Readjuster,”&mdash;a new Sanguinometer, the invention of Saint
Andronicus Carnivorous and Pharaoh Phrique, two very eminent
Brethren&mdash;which, when put under the Stream, showed
with the utmost accuracy, when and how much the allowance
to the Handle turners must be <i>reduced</i>.</p>

<p>This marvelous and unique instrument had two faces, one of
which was towards the Brethren around the Tank and the other
towards the grinders at the Handle. On that facing the fleas
was registered only the <i>rise</i> of the stream, and on that facing
the grinders were registered only the <i>downward fluctuations of
the rise</i>. The readings of this impartial instrument, said the
fleas, should determine the rise and fall of the allowance to the
Handle turners; whenever the reading showed a rise, the wages
should go <i>up</i>, but whenever the reading showed a fall the
wages should go <i>down</i>. But as the register of the rise was always
invisible to the dogs, and the fleas were scrupulously dumb
as to what they saw, the Sanguinometer never <i>showed</i> a rise,
but always the downward fluctuations; therefore the licks at
the spoon were always reduced. So the dogs did groan by
reason of the Sanguinometer.</p>

<p>Moreover, the fleas, having given ear unto the wise counsel of
Pharaoh Phrique and Saint Andronicus (who said, however,
that he was a modest flea and a flea of reputation, and did not
want the honor of appearing in the matter), issued an edict that
henceforth each and every dog that had the gracious privilege
of being allowed to help turn the Handle must, on entering the
service, cut off two toes and throw them into the hopper, as an
initiation fee and an evidence of good faith towards the company
below, said two toes or their equivalent to be returned to
the depositor when he left the service at the Handle&mdash;if he ever
did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>At which the dogs lifted up their voices and wept sore; but
weeping did not save them; for the fleas told the chuckers-in
to tell the grinders that there were crowds of hungry dogs
around the corner, standing ready and anxious to take their
places at the Handle and willing to give three toes for the privilege.
Which was all true; for in spite of the awful hunger of
the dogs at the Handle, and their common fate of dropping
down faint and being thrown into the hopper, there were hundreds
of pinched and meagre dogs, who sat around on their
haunches casting covetous and envious glances at the workers,
and hoping to see some fall; yea, so eagerly anxious were they
for a chance at the Handle, to earn a little lick at the spoon,
that when they saw one growing faint and ready to fall, they
would all rush forward and fight amongst themselves to be first
to be taken on by the chuckers-in; and it became the common
practice of almost everyone to creep up behind any fainting dog
and slyly pinch his tail or bite his leg, in order to make him
faint quicker and let go of the Handle.</p>

<p>So the grinding dogs, finding themselves helpless, did cut off
two toes and fling them into the hopper, and ground and
groaned and wept, and got their little lick at the smeared spoon,
and fainted by scores, and were mercilessly flung into the
hopper. And the Brethren around the Tank grew bigger and
fuller and tighter every day; and as the Stream grew thicker
and thicker, they grew more querulous and angry at the pesky
laziness of good-for-nothing dogs that could not be encouraged
to diligence, no, not by “good wages” and a steady position at
the Handle; and they sent up more savage conundrums, wanting
to know why the two Satans they didn’t turn, and what in
the two Everlasting Profundos they meant by robbing and
cheating their masters and driving them to bankruptcy?</p>

<p>To all of which the dogs at the Handle replied that they had
reached the limit of canine endurance, and would stop the turning
of the Handle unless the company of Brethren would raise
their allowance of blood to the standard of the old liberal smearing
of the little spoon, and abolish the requisition of two toes to
the hopper. To which the fleas angrily made reply that the
dogs at the Handle might all go to the bottom of the Everlastingist
Profundo, for they would put other more docile and
appreciative dogs at the Handle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Whereupon the dogs struck, and the Handle came to rest,
and the Blood Stream stopped. But the fleas sat patiently
around the Tank and leisurely drank themselves full, and sent
for the other hungry dogs that anxiously sat around; and the
other dogs did come, and were set upon and worried and
wounded by the original grinders. But the chuckers-in and
the police dogs did help the new dogs and slew divers of the
first Handle turners and finally routed them. Then did the
first Handle turners go meekly crawling on their bellies to the
company of the fleas, and humbly confess their sins and beg to
be reinstated at the Handle. But the company deigned not to
speak unto them, but sent out unto them Brother Pharaoh
Phrique, who lifted up his nose high in the air, and said unto
them: “Well; what will ye?” And the dogs cast down their
eyes and hugged the dust with their bellies and answered:
“That thy bondservants may find favor in thy sight and be reinstated
at the Handle.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened like
unto armor plate, and he said: “Not so, ye wicked dogs; faithless
and perverse generation of dogs, despisers of our goodness
and mercy; ye shall in no wise return to your positions at the
Handle, save and unless ye shall be content to receive as wages
no more Blood than can be carried upon the point of a needle,
and shall first contribute five toes to the hopper, and execute a
contract to fling into the Mill all the little bow-wows that shall
henceforth be born unto you.”</p>

<p>And all the dogs, with sighs and wailing and grievous lamentations,
did consent, and went and turned the Handle and
groaned for a Savior.</p>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>IT came to pass one day when the Handle went more heavily than usual,
that one dog was seen to jump up from his work with a yelp as though
bitten by ten thousand fleas all at once. His eyes rolled in a fine
frenzy; he rolled over and over on the ground and turned somersaults by
the dozen. All the dogs at the Handle were temporarily paralyzed with
consternation, and dropped work to inquire what was amiss. “What’s the
matter?” said one of the crowd to him; but he only yelped the harder and
turned more somersaults. “He’s gone crazy with hunger,” said they; “we
must put him in the madhouse;” and they seized him by the ears and the
tail for to take him there; which caused him suddenly to come back to
sobriety.</p>

<p>“Brethren,” said he, “while turning at that infernal Handle
I was suddenly seized with an Idea. It is a grand Idea; it is
none other than how we may ameliorate the cruel lot of the
grinders at the Handle and raise our wages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“Raise our wages?” they all cried in astonishment, letting
go of the Handle. “Oh tell us how, and tell us quickly.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “you see, it stands to Common Sense that
if all dogs would combine and agree not to turn that Handle for
less than so much a day, those big bloats would have to give it
us or suffer the cessation of the Stream.”</p>

<p>“That’s so; so it is,” cried the other dogs in astonishment;
“we never thought of that; why, that must be one of those
Revelations, those deep abstrusities which the philosophers call
‘Axioms’&mdash;self-evident truths. And only to think it was
given to a common dog to make the discovery! But canst thou
tell us, oh wonderful discoverer, how we may all combine, with
all those other dogs around us who cannot get a chance at the
Handle? That is a problem, beside the complexity of which
the Great Truth is simplicity itself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ye simpletons,” said the dog with the Idea, “these
things are hidden from the wise and prudent and are revealed
unto pups. The thing is self-evidently simple. All we require
is simply <i>that all dogs shall agree</i>.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the other dogs, “how art thou going to get the
outside dogs to agree not to turn except for so much, when now
they neither turn nor get a lick; it is simply asking a dog to
abstain from doing what he hasn’t done, and is not going to do.
The agreement can only interest <i>those at the Handle</i>, while it
does not interest the others who want to be there but cannot
get there.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the dog with the Idea, “we at the Handle must
keep up <i>our</i> wages, anyhow; so I propose that <i>we</i> make the
agreement and that, as a mark to be known by, each dog that
agrees, have a white label bound on his right hind leg; and we
will further agree that whomsoever has not on the ‘White
Label’ shall be called a Black Leg and be worried and cast away
from the Handle.”</p>

<p>But there arose another dog, and said he had an Idea, too, that
was much better. Said he: “Suppose all of us do adopt the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>

White Label, and do live up to the solemn agreement&mdash;which
is not probable&mdash;what will it avail us to worry and cast away from
the Handle all those that have not the White Label, when there
are so many more dogs who through hunger will jump in to
take their places? <i>We can’t worry them all.</i> My Idea is to
lengthen the Handle so that all the unemployed dogs can catch
on and help to turn.”</p>

<p>But some said, “What good would that do? You could not
make it long enough to give every dog a place; and besides,
the Handle belongs to the Mill, and the Mill belongs to the
fleas, and they won’t permit it to be lengthened, so that
settles it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” replied the other dog, “let us agree to work
fewer hours so as to put some of the unemployed at the Handle;
average things, as to speak.”</p>

<p>“Bow-wow wow-wow!” barked all the other dogs in chorus.
“What! Put ourselves on half time for unemployed dogs!
Why, we don’t make a living as it is on full time. Thou art no
friend of ours. Want <i>us</i> to reduce <i>our</i> wages, do you? Out
with him!” And they worried <i>him</i> and cast <i>him</i> out.</p>

<p>And it was so that they did agree; and each dog did bind on
his right hind leg a White Label and they called themselves the
Great United Order of White-Legged Handle Turners, and
called themselves “White Legs” for short.</p>

<p>By this time the big bloats around the Tank, having perceived
that the Mill was going very slowly on account of the grinders’
attention being taken up with the Agreement, sent up to them
a terrible conundrum wanting to know why the half-a-dozen
Satans they didn’t grind, and what in half-a-dozen Everlasting
Profundos they meant by robbing their employers by such
laziness.</p>

<p>But when it was told them that the grinders had been taking
a recess to hold a mysterious confab, and that all the Handle
Turners had white badges on their right hind legs, they called
down several of the dogs and demanded of them what this new

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>

thing should mean? And one of the dogs meekly answered
that they had formed an Association of White Legs, and that
the purpose of the said Association was to petition the big fleas
at the Tank to raise their allowance of blood to the old standard
of the good licks at the liberally smeared spoon, when they first
began to turn the Handle.</p>

<p>And the big fleas said that was all right, and it did them great
credit to wish to better their condition, and that provided they
confined their efforts to mutual help, and to making their members
more honest, industrious and well behaved, and to improving
their minds in their leisure hours, and didn’t go to
<i>demanding</i> more blood, but left the raising of their allowance
entirely to the good judgment and good-heartedness of their
employers, and didn’t go to violating the inalienable rights of
their employers to shove away from the Handle any objectionable
dog, or the inalienable rights of the unlabelled dogs to take
their places at the Handle and to make free contracts as free-born
dogs should, and didn’t conspire to incite to breaches of
the Blood and Bones Grinding Laws, but confined themselves
to peaceful methods and the use of moral suasion, why, they
would have their hearty good wishes for their prosperity, and
everything would be lovely.</p>

<p>So the dogs returned to their fellows and reported the gracious
reception they had met with, and all the White Legs rejoiced
and went back to their grinding with a will and with new hopes
in their hearts. But though the dogs turned for many days,
they found things go on just as usual; they turned and ground
and fainted and were thrown into the hopper, but their allowance
was not raised, although they sent down many humble
petitions to the fleas to raise it.</p>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>SO at last the White Leg dogs, weary unto death with waiting for the
fruit which came not on the barren fig tree of the big fleas’ “hearty
good wishes,” resolved that they would <i>demand</i> a larger allowance.</p>

<p>Therefore they sent down some of the big and bold dogs, to tell the
fleas around the Tank that unless they would restore their allowance
to what it was at first, and abolish the contribution of toes, and the
chucking in of fainting dogs, and would grease the bearings of the
Handle, and reduce the number of their working hours, and refuse to
employ any dog that had not on the White Label, and would do and not
do, many other things most astonishing to the fleas, the dogs would
all take their White Labels and twist them all together into a most
unbreakable rope, and therewith tie up the Handle with such unheard-of
and untieable knots, that nobody on earth save the White Legs, would be
able to release it. Whereupon the Mill would stop, and the Stream would
dry up, and the fleas would collapse, and other great miseries would
come upon them.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>

Therefore it behooved them to listen to reason, and grant
their reasonable requests ere it were too late, and the Handle were tied
up.</p>

<p>But the fleas showed no alarm and went on filling themselves.
They simply turned towards Pharaoh Phrique, and said:
“Brother Phrique, thou art learned in all the learning of the
Egyptian taskmasters. Thou art a skillful hide skinner and
dog walloper, and well versed in the secret art of squelching
insolence and ill behavior. Thou wast our trusty counsel in
our late fight with these dogs, before they got this White Label
craze, and thou didst bring us through it with honor and dividends.
Thou wast our High Tower, our Shield and Hiding
Place, whereunto we ran and were safe&mdash;all save our beloved
Andronicus Carnivorous, who gat himself over the pond for hiding.
We trust thee; deal with them as seemeth thee good.”</p>

<p>So Pharaoh hardened his heart as aforetime, and spake thus
unto the dogs: “Dogs that ye are; insolent despisers of your
precious privileges. I chastened you once before, thinking to
bring your erring feet into the path of duty and wisdom. But
ye are a stiff-necked and perverse generation. Ye have heaped
sin upon sin. Not content with having tried to rob us before,
ye have formed a Union, which is to commit the Unpardonable
Sin. Get out of this, therefore; vamose the ranch; put; scoot;
absquatulate; skedaddle, and make yourselves scarce; for I
swear that even as our brother Webbfoot and Brother Gold Jay,
and other of our brethren did chastise <i>their</i> dogs once, I will
chastise you. Yea, I will so grind and crush you that the
whole world shall hear the sound thereof, for I, Pharaoh
Phrique, have said it. Tie up the Handle with your rope of
White Labels; it shall be unto me as tow burnt with the fire;
for I will dissolve your Union and scatter the members thereof,
and give your heritage unto the Unlabeled and more obedient
Black Legs. Git!” And he drove them from his presence.</p>

<p>But the dogs did tie up the Handle, and the Mill did stop,
and some of the catastrophes foretold did happen. But Pharaoh

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>

Phrique whistled to the Black Legs to come and gnaw the rope.
And he went by night down to a secret place in Canisville, called
the Devil’s Cheap Bargain Counter, where certain lewd and
ferocious dogs of the baser sort, which had Pink Eyes that could
not bear the sunshine, did for a few scraps
of dirty bread and meat, hire themselves out
on foggy and moonless nights to worry and
kill any other dogs that were objectionable
to the fleas; and he paid them handsomely to
go by night and secretly get behind the
White Legs and tear them to pieces.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="Illustration: THE DEVIL’S PINK EYED CHEAP BARGAIN COUNTER DOG." width="200" height="272" />
</div>

<p>And there was a great fight. The hungry
Black Legs fought to untie the Handle,
and the Devil’s Pink Eyed Cheap
Bargain Counter Dogs helped them.
And so it came to pass that the White
Legs were driven away; and some hastened to pull off the White
Labels and mingle with the Black Legs, and scrambled to get
back to the Handle.</p>

<p>And at the going down of the sun the rope was broken; and
the handle, untied, was going like mad. And Pharaoh Phrique
and the Brethren were holding a praise meeting around the
Tank, and giving God thanks that He had so signally made
bare His mighty arm and scattered their enemies, who had
come so near breaking up the Foundations of Society.</p>

<p>So the poor dogs, with broken hearts and broken hopes, did
grind on and on for many days, and the victory of the Monstrous
Fleas seemed to be complete.</p>

<p>It came to pass, however, that a new hope sprang up among
the toilers at the Handle. Owing to their incessant occupation
during their long days, they had no leisure to think, but they
gathered together during the short night to growl and snarl,
and damn things in general and greedy fleas in particular.
They schemed and plotted many remedies which all came to
naught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>But one night, one of the dogs that had a big head and looked
to have wisdom, got up and said: “Brethren, I do perceive
that all these violent methods of rectifying our wrongs do fail.
Now, I pray you, consider; we dogs be many and these fleas be
few, why then are we not their masters? Why are we their
slaves? I know that fleas have been divinely ordained to find
us employment, and dogs to serve them, in the Fear of God,
for even so hath the much-salaried barker in the Church of
the Fleas,&mdash;the great Reverend Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite&mdash;told
us, and he knoweth a thing or two about God’s purposes.
But, as the same much-salaried barker also saith, they
were ordained to be kind to us and treat us with justice and
mercy. But, brethren, ye know that they do treat us most
devilishly. Now, all this comes to pass because they do not
know how many we are and what we think about them.
There’s where it is, brethren; if we had some regular and
orderly method of telling them how many we are, and what
we think of them, they would surely give heed unto our
cries and demands, for we are many&mdash;very many. If we
could authoritatively&mdash;<i>authoritatively</i>, brethren,&mdash;state to
them our Will, they would surely ameliorate our lot and treat
us with generosity. And when they have once been made to
know what is the Expressed Will of the Dogs, they will see
that it is Public Opinion and will bow to it. Thus, my brethren,
shall we be FREE.”</p>

<p>And all the other dogs arose on their hind legs and cried in a
great chorus: “It is an Inspiration, it is an Inspiration: it
cometh from Above.”</p>

<p>And the dog, seeing that his idea was well received, was
encouraged and went on, “Brethren, this idea is far better than
the White Label idea, or that of lengthening the Handle.
Those methods are merely empirical nostrums and expedients,
but this is a radical remedy and a perfect cure. Now behold
the application of it. I have invented a device which I call
the ‘Will of the Dogs Expresser.’ It is a little box with a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>

little slot in the top thereof, and hath a bottom that openeth by
way of a little trap door into a long shute. I propose to fix up
the slotted box right near the Handle of the Mill (with the
sanction, of course, of the owners thereof) so that the long shute
shall reach right down to where the big fleas sit. And it shall
be that on certain days (by permission of the fleas) every dog
shall receive a little strip of paper on which he shall write his
Will (if he have one), and shall fold it up and drop it through
the little slot into the little box. And it shall be that when the
little box is full some one shall pull down the little trap door
in the bottom thereof, when the load of papers shall go in a
thundering avalanche down the shute into the midst of the fleas
around the Tank, and they shall know that the Will of the
Dogs Expresser hath spoken. Then shall the fleas sort out the
bits of paper, and it shall be that if there be more bits of paper
that will one thing, than there are that will another thing, then
the thing willed on the greater number shall be done. Thus
ye see, my brethren, we may will whatsoever we will, and the
greater will shall be done. Therefore brethren, whatsoever
evils we suffer for the future, will be all due to our own fault.”</p>

<p>And all the dogs approved the plan, and sent a committee
down next day to the fleas to see if they had any objections to
the new invention. And to the delight of the dogs, the big fleas
said they thought it an excellent idea, that reflected great credit
on the inventor thereof, and he ought to be rewarded by
appointment to the place of Chucker-in-in-Chief at the hopper,
and they thought the plan would be a very healthy form of
amusement for the dogs, and would tend to Good Order and the
Stability of Institutions, and they wished all success to the
Expresser. Furthermore, they graciously offered <i>to do the
counting</i> of the papers at the bottom of the shute; and they
even went so far as to graciously condescend to be the Public
Servants of the dogs at the Handle, and do anything the dogs,
by their Expresser, might order them to do, saying that, seeing
fleas had all wealth and leisure and power and respectability,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>

none could be so fit to carry out effectively the Will of the
Dogs.</p>

<p>But what astounded the dogs with an astonishment that
struck them blind and dumb, was that the fleas begged the dogs
to allow them the privilege of becoming their Equals on the
great Paper Dropping Day, and drop <i>their</i> little Wills into the
little box with the little slot in it.</p>

<p>So the committee returned and reported the gracious way in
which they had been received, the wonderful affability of the
fleas, and their condescension in offering themselves as the Servants
of the dogs.</p>

<p>Whereupon the dogs did rejoice with exceeding great joy
that they had at last found a Sovereign Remedy for their sorrows.</p>

</div>
<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>THEN did the dogs set up the little box with the little slot in it;
and upon a day appointed they went every one and dropped into it little
papers, upon some of which was written that the fleas must inquire
into the hard condition of the dogs, with a view to ameliorating it;
and on some it was written that the fleas need not inquire into their
condition, with a view, etc., for there were some dogs that were afraid
to have a Will, lest it should be known that they had expressed it and
should be discharged from the Handle.</p>

<p>So when all the papers had been dropped through the slot
and the box was full, the trap in the bottom thereof was pulled,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>

and the load of papers went down in a thundering avalanche by
the shute into the midst of the fleas. And the fleas sorted them
and counted them, and one arose and said, “Oyez! Oyez! the
Will of the Dogs Expresser hath spoken and there is a Great
Majority; and the Great Majority commandeth that we, as
their Public Servants, do forthwith inquire into the hard condition
of the dogs at the Handle, with a view to ameliorating it.
We must therefore bow to the Mandate, and look into their
condition, with a view, etc.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the fleas did immediately appoint a Solemn Mummery
Committee to take with them telescopes and microscopes,
spectacles and eye-glasses to go and look into the condition of
the dogs, with a view, etc. And when the dogs saw them coming
they barked propitiatingly and wagged their tails delightedly
to see the fleas come at the Mandate of the Expresser, and they
prophesied great good things of comfort to come of it.</p>

<div class="topspace4"></div>

</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>And the fleas did look into their condition. Some stood afar
off and viewed the grinding dogs through their telescopes, and
made notes of what they saw; and some, with their microscopes
got quite near and closely examined their prominent ribs and
sore backs and blood-shot eyes and their generally measly
appearance, and made voluminous notes; while the rest made
general surveys through their spectacles and eye-glasses, and
made notes.</p>

<p>Thus did the Committee gather a huge Mass of Statistics
which they promised the dogs they would Publish, which promise
made the dogs to dance for joy.</p>

<p>And after many days the fleas rolled up what they called a
Volume, bulky with Facts and Figures, and fat with Platitudes
and Suggestions concerning the amelioration of the grievous
condition of the Handle Turning Dogs, which the Volume
called the Great Question of the Day.</p>

<p>And the fleas sent up a bill to the dogs which recited that this
great Volume, gotten up for their benefit, had cost the fleas an
enormous amount of time and labor which must be recouped
unto them by the dogs, and that it would require the dogs to
grind an hour a day more for one year.</p>

<p>So the dogs did grind and sigh an hour a day more, but had
great faith in the Will Expresser which</p>

<p class="center">
“* * * Moved in a mysterious way,<br />
Its wonders to perform.”
</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>In process of time there came about a grave quarrel among
the fleas around the Tank, and they began to call each other
names. The quarrel began by those farthest away from the
Spout getting jealous of those that sat nearest thereto, for they
said those that sat nigh unto got a better chance to help themselves
to the blood, and consequently got fatter than those that
sat far away, which those sitting nearest declared to be all nonsense

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>

and a libel on their honors. Nevertheless, it so happened
that they <i>did</i> get fatter and bigger than those that sat farther
away; and though they disclaimed violently that their extra
fatness was due to their proximity to the Spout they did not
volunteer to change places with the farther off ones. Therefore
the Faraways&mdash;who were nearly all Low Pressurists&mdash;began to
push and shove to get up near to the Spout, and the Nighuntos&mdash;who
were mostly High Pressurists&mdash;did push and shove to
maintain their places, not, said they, because they <i>wanted</i> to
sit nigh unto the Spout, but as a matter of Principle, because
they were the lineal descendants of a Grand Old Party of High
Pressure Suckers that had once, a many years before, rushed to
the rescue and salvation of the Spout, when a lot of Low Pressure
Suckers, the lineal ancestors of the present pesky Low
Pressurists, had made a dastardly and traitorous attempt to
break it off and cripple the Mill.</p>

<p>And there was a mighty shoving; and the Nighuntos indignantly
said unto the Faraways, “Whom are ye a shoving of?”
And much bad temper was shown, and upon several occasions
divers of them got hurt.</p>

<p>Then did some of the acute Faraways hit upon a way of
strengthening themselves to shove the Nighuntos away from the
Spout and get there themselves. Said they, “Why not get the
dogs to help us to shove?” So they sent secretly for the
inventor of the Will of the Dogs Expresser and said unto him,
“Lo! We be Dog Admirers, and believe that your hard condition
should be ameliorated. It is quite plain to any thinking
mind that your long days of grinding at the Handle and your
bloodless condition are due to those cruelly greedy Nighuntos
that sit close up to the Spout. They are never satisfied. The
Tank does not require half the blood that flows into it. All the
rest, these suckers deliberately appropriate for their own private
fattening.</p>

<p>“Now if <i>we</i> sat near the Spout we would reduce the flow of
blood to the requirements of the Tank, ‘<i>economically administered</i>,’

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>

and would cause all that now unnecessarily flows into it to be given to
the dogs at the Handle, <i>to whom it rightfully belongs</i>. Thus will the
number of your hours of toil be reduced. Promise us therefore that the
next time ye use your great and ever blessed Expresser, ye will send a
thundering avalanche of papers down the shute ordering the Nighuntos to
get away from the Spout, and us Faraways to take their places. So shall
your hard condition be ameliorated indeed.”</p>

<p>And the Inventor, with his tail brandished on high, ran back
to his fellow toilers at the Handle, crying, “Joy! Joy! Deliverance!
Behold; the Faraways, who are our friends, have promised
that if we will order the Nighuntos, by the Will of the Dogs
Expresser, to give place at the Spout to the Faraways, they will
administer the Tank and the Spout <i>in our interest</i>.”</p>

<p>But the Nighuntos got to hear that the Faraways had made a
treaty of mutual help with the dogs. So <i>they</i> sent a delegation
up to the grinders, saying, “Be not deceived; these Faraway
Low Pressurists are frauds. Their love for you is all in our eye.
They wish to get nigh unto the Spout only for to make <i>themselves</i>
fat. And what is more, we know that they are traitors to
dogs in general and to you Handle Turners in particular, for we
have discovered that they have been engaged for a long time in
a dastardly plot to break down this Infant Industry of dog
grinding, in which you and we are <i>mutually interested</i>, and to
uproot this whole Mill from its foundations, and sell it and the
Handle&mdash;by the turning of which ye are maintained in constant
employment at high wages&mdash;to your enemies the pauper dogs
of Kyhidom, who will thus turn you out of employment, to
wander about seeking for a Handle to turn and finding none.
Therefore, do not listen to the plausible lies they tell; but
remember that Dogs at the Handle and Fleas at the Tank are
ONE and retain us close to the Spout&mdash;us, who are its Natural
Guardians, and who were its Shield and Salvation in its Hour of
Peril in the time past&mdash;and ye shall have more steady employment
than ever. Be wise, and set your faces as flint against this

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>

conspiracy. Let your watchword be “High Wages and Protection
to our Native Handle Turners.” They be liars and the
party of immoral ideas, and are merely Dog Admirers. But we
be the Only Original Truth Speakers and Dog Worshippers.”</p>

<p>And it was so that the words of the Only Original Truth
Speakers sank deeply into the hearts of the Handle Turners;
and great fear and discumfuzzlement fell upon many of them.
And they were divided in opinion. Some said the Dog Worshippers
spake wisely, for all knew that the dogs of Kyhidom
had always been their enemies; and no doubt it was true that
the dogs of Kyhidom had seduced the Faraway Low Pressure
Dog Admirers to sell the Mill and take away the Handle. And
others said that the Dog Worshippers must be a greedy, unconscionable
lot of Suckers who made large pretenses of friendship
and love to the Handle Turners simply to retain their fat positions
at the Spout, since no one, under the most rigid scrutiny and
cross-examination, had ever been able to adduce the twenty
thousand millionth part of an instance where a High Pressure
Sucker had ever sought anything other than the enlargement of
his own private and particular paunch.</p>

<p>So when the great Paper Dropping Day came around there
was much barking and snarling and wrangling as to who ought
to be placed near the Spout; and the two sets of fleas were
trembling between great hopes and great fears; and each set
shouted its hardest to the dogs to be wise and to be faithful to
<i>their own best interests</i> by dropping their papers for <i>it</i> in the
slot of the little Expresser.</p>

<p>And there was much noise and confusion during the filling of
the little box. And when the little trap door was pulled and the
papers went in a thundering avalanche down the shute, each set
of fleas tried to run away with the Great Majority regardless of
what was written upon them. But after much fighting it was
finally declared that the Great Majority of Wills was for the
Faraways to sit up near the Spout, and for the Nighuntos to
get far away. Then did both the Faraways and Nighuntos rise
up and beautifully make obeisance to the Expressed Will of
the Dogs, the heretofore Faraways bowing even to the ground;
but the heretofore Nighuntos merely inclined their noses, and
said “Damn” in soliloquial whispers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" alt="Illustration: PAPER DROPPING BOX." width="600" height="424" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>So the Faraways got up close to the Spout and became the
Nighuntos, and the Nighuntos were shoved to the lower end of
the Tank and became the Faraways, and began in <i>their</i> turn to
hustle and shove and charge the Nighuntos with selfishly using
the Spout to make themselves fat.</p>

<p>And the dogs of the Majority were very happy, and took a
day off (by gracious permission of the new Nighuntos) to bark
and stand on their heads and burn fuel and make great smoke
and stench, and do other idiotic things to show the great joy
they felt at having put another set of suckers near the Spout.</p>

<p>Then they returned to diligently turn the Handle and hope
for great good times. Which came not.</p>

<p>And after many days of the same old grind, being taunted by
the dogs of the Minority who every morning said, “We told
you so,” and every evening said, “Thus did we prophesy unto
you,” the dogs of the Majority sent down to ask the new Nighuntos
about what time the dogs at the Handle might expect the
peep of the Better Day and the fruition of the Promises?</p>

<p>To which the Nighunto Dog Admirers solemnly made answer
that they had made the fearful discovery that the tank was on
two bases, one of gold and the other of silver, and that the
Silver Basis had shrunk and got so dreadfully awry that the
Tank had fallen all askew on that side, and was in danger of
capsizing altogether, so that they were all in a dreadful stew,
and had to give all their attention to the Great Question of getting
it into position again on a Single Gold Basis that would
command their Confidence, and never, never, never give way
again, and that all mere dog starvation and trouble were trivialities
compared to the great overshadowing need of saving the
Tank from ruin. Besides, the Faraway Dog Worshippers were
now in control of the lower end of the Tank, and had, previous

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>

to its slipping with its Silver Basis, wickedly bored a hole in
it and drawn off the Surplus, and were in other ways most
unpatriotically hampering the Dog Admirers in their efforts to
economize and reduce the Stream; that there was a Great
Deficiency to be made up, and that it would be some years at
least before they would be in a Position to effect much Reform,
and that <i>for the present</i> it was absolutely necessary for the
dogs to make up the Great Deficiency in the Tank, and must
grind an hour a day longer for at least a year.</p>

<p>Which caused the dogs to go sadly back to their hungry
turning of the Handle, and to wonder why the great Will of the
Dogs Expresser required so much eternity its wonders to
perform.</p>

<p>“See ye not, my brethren,” said he, “that the Stream faileth?
The arc it describeth is not so large as aforetime, which
meaneth that the hopper above is not replenished to its full
capacity, which further meaneth that either those rascally
chuckers-in are not doing their full duty, or that the supply of
dogs to chuck in is running low.”</p>

<p>This discovery filled the other Brethren with terror, and they
looked first at their own big and bloated bodies&mdash;which by this
time had become mere featureless blood bags&mdash;and then at the
Stream, so visibly running low, and, trembling with a coward
fear, cried out: “Oh, who will save us from perishing? For
the Blood is our life and it faileth. Oh, pestilence, fury and
plague, we shall grow <i>less</i>! Oh, we don’t mind bursting with
bigness; but oh, to grow <i>little</i> again! Oh! all is vanity under the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>

Sun! We did think that Providence, for whom we have done
so much, would have given us this day our daily dogs to grind.
But He has gone back on us. <i>Us</i>, brethren, who never went
back on Him and never let his churches want for any good
thing. All is lost! lost!! lost!!!”</p>

<p>And they bewailed and lamented sore; and one, at the contemplation
of his possible shrinkage, went temporarily insane
and waddled out and killed himself.</p>

<p>But the Discoverer spoke up and said: “Allay your fears,
and assuage your grief, my brethren; all is not lost by a long
chalk. I have excogitated a Scheme which I think will work.
Behold! are there not more dogs on the earth than the dogs of
Canisville? Yea, verily! dogs more weary, languid and sore
distressed than they? I have heard that in Hungryland, over
the pond, away beyond Kyhidom, are millions of dogs who are
dreadfully flea-bitten and exhausted, who would think it getting
verily to heaven if they could come here and get such bountiful
wages as we allow to our grinding dogs.</p>

<p>“Go to, now. Let us send forth apostle dogs to Hungryland
that shall tell the dogs there of the wonderful heaven of peace
and joy and plenty in the West; of the Great Wages paid to
honest toil, thrift and temperance; of the Boundless Opportunities
open to honest ambition; of the Liberty there, and the
Absolute Equality of the Rich and Poor before the Law; how in
that wonderful land the Dogs and not the Fleas do the governing,
and set up and pull down their Public Servants at their
own sweet will and pleasure, by means of the little box with the
little slot in it. And let the apostles hold up aloft the brilliant
example of our dearly beloved brother, Saint Andronicus Carnivorous,
who came over from North Kyhidom as mean a dog
as any of them, and all by his own unaided Toil and Thrift and
Temperance&mdash;without even the blessing of God, in whom he
taketh no stock&mdash;put himself through the Great Transformation
and became as big and bloated a flea as the most excellent
of us, and wrote a Book. And let them say that he is not the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span>

only example by many thousands of the Illimitable Possibilities
of this land; and they will come rushing over by thousands,
and our chuckers-in shall seize them. Thus shall the hopper
of our prosperity be replenished with an everlasting supply, and
the former bigness of the Blood Stream be restored&mdash;aye, more
than restored, for we will enlarge the Spout and widen and
deepen the hopper and elongate the Handle, and the rushing
thousands from Hungryland will fight for a chance to grind.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>“Thus shall we have more dogs to be ground up and more
dogs to grind them, and as there will always be standing around
the Handle a vast multitude licking their chops in hope of seeing
the grinders faint and fall, we shall be able to diminish our
great expenses by reducing the great quantity of blood we are
now compelled by cruel circumstances to put on the end of the
needle&mdash;which is a great imposition. So shall the blood spurt
out in great style, and we will have a larger Tank, so that more
fleas can sit around it; and we will drink and drink and grow

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span>

and grow and become so great as never was. And then will we
put down the insolence of those white-legged dogs, who have
so often troubled us by entering into unconstitutional conspiracies
to hamper us and overthrow the liberties of free-born dogs
to make free contracts with us to grind for the wages we offer.
Having handy so many thousands of Black Legs, we will not
need the White Legs any more, but will have them all chucked
into the hopper. Moreover, I think, we will be able, with all
this inexhaustible supply of blood coming in, to heal our internal
disagreements and sink all our little superficial distinctions
of Low Pressurists and High Pressurists, and truly appear what
we really are&mdash;One Common Family of Blood Drinkers; for there
will then be blood enough for each and all of us. Then will
we, working together as One United Family abolish that infernal
nuisance of the little box with the little slot in it. Ye all
know, brethren, that the day off which the dogs, through the
unbecoming schism amongst ourselves, take to work the Will
of the Dogs Expresser, is a dead loss to us in the cessation of
the grind. I appeal to you, brethren, to consider the great loss
we suffer; calculate the number of dogs that might be chucked
in during the twenty-four hours spent in the wicked and wasteful
amusement of Paper Dropping, and the further loss accruing
from the lazy turning of the Handle next day, owing to the
enervating and mind distracting hilarity of the previous day.
Let us then be wise and consult our best interest. Thus Brethren
shall we have a time, times and half a time of fatness, ease
and prosperity.”</p>

<p>These words brought joy and hope to the Brethren; and all
said the suggestions of the Discoverer were as the turning
inside out of the Dark Cloud to show its Silver Lining; some
called them a Providential Relief; and some said they went to
show that this world was run by the Creator on the principle of
Universal Harmony and the Compensation Balance, in that
what one part thereof lacked another supplied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>Saint Andronicus Carnivorous was the only one not entirely
enthusiastic. He arose and cautiously said, “Brethren, the
proposition of our dear brother, the Discoverer, lacketh nothing
that is highly to be approved. No doubt it will be highly profitable
to us, and therein I am heartily with him&mdash;especially in
that part relating to the abolition of the wicked White Legs,
and the unwholesome box with the little slot in it. But I want
you to give me a guarantee that there will be no danger in it to
<i>me</i>. You know I have a Reputation which is very dear to me;
and if these Hungry Dogs come here and find the Truth is not
as preached, they will reproach me as one of you, and so I and
my Reputation and my Book will fall into contempt, and they
may go even so far as to call me a Hypocrite. Therefore I
would rather not be seen in the matter; and so, will hie me
away until the reproach be over.”</p>

<p>To which the others made answer that there was very little
danger or reproach in the scheme; that the Hungry Dogs would
get all the disappointment, the apostles all the reproach, and the
fleas all the profit; but that to be on the safe side Saint Andronicus
had better go away over the pond and lie low, and they
would find some one of a Don’t-care-a-d&mdash;&mdash; disposition, like
Brother Pharaoh Phrique, to carry out the scheme, particularly
the abolition of the White Legs and the flinging of them into
the hopper.</p>

<p>And it was so that Carnivorous did go away and lie low; and
the apostles did go out into all the world of the Hungry Dogs
and preach the Gospel of Lies; and the Hungry Dogs were
beguiled and came over and brought their great hunger with
them, and by their great ferocity the White Legs were wrenched
away from the Handle and thrown by the chuckers-in into the
hopper.</p>

<p>And in that day the Low Pressure Dog Admirers and the High
Pressure Dog Worshippers were made friends again and became
One; and they ordered the Hungry Dogs to break up the box
with the little slot in it and burn it with fire; and the Mill was

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span>

enlarged; and the Stream was thicker and stronger than ever;
and the Tank was enlarged; and the United Fleas sat around
and drank themselves fuller, and grew so big that they shut
out the sky and the light of the Sun; and by reason thereof
a great and deadly darkness came over the land, and in the
shadow thereof all plants of the light, such as Honesty, Truth,
Liberty, and Municipal, State and National Rectitude, went
mouldy and rotten; and the big, over-bloated fleas, by reason
of their great gluttony, grew leprous and stank, and their evil
odor filled the air; wherefore great sickness and plagues broke
out everywhere, which carried off many dogs and some fleas.</p>

<p>And through all this evil time the dogs ground and fainted
and sighed and howled, and sent up blasphemies and curses and
prayers to a Heaven that was very deaf to them, but was apparently
very good to the monstrosities that sat around the Tank.</p>

</div>
<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>CHAOS reigned in Canisville. Hell seemed to have
grown so hungry for victims that it had not patience
to wait for the coming down of the dogs to <i>it</i>, in
the natural course of time, but had gone up to devour
them on earth. Dogs everywhere were the
property of the fleas, either by direct settlement on
their bodies or by deputy. All that were not struggling
by serving the Monstrous Fleas at the Handle
were wandering around carrying little fleas and hunting hard for
bones and scraps. The only exceptions were a few obstinate
headed and obdurate hearted dogs, who had said they would
have freedom at any cost. They said they would not turn that
infernal Handle, neither would they carry and maintain any
fleas. So they defiantly went about picking up scraps, and
when the little fleas came hopping onto them, and demanding
as their right to suck out of them the nutriment the scraps
gave them, those dogs did snarl and reach around for them with
their teeth and violently shake them off.</p>

<p>Then did those little fleas complain unto McPoodle that there
were certain wicked dogs that objected to be bled; and McPoodle
said he would not stand it in his dominions; and the Monstrous
Fleas when they heard about it, said it was Robbery of the Little
Brethren, and a contagious Bad Example that might spread
throughout Society; and they spake unto their salaried barker
in the Church, Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite, that he speak
over the big book that lay on the costly cushion, against the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>

sin of dogs stealing their own bodies away from the bites of the
fleas. And the barker did speak, and the good and well behaved
dogs who carried their fleas and bore their hunger piously
did regard with severity and high disapproval all those dogs
that shook their fleas, insomuch that the flea shakers found
themselves in ill odor and did withdraw themselves from dog
society, and sought lonely places where meat was scarce and
fleas scarcer.</p>

<p>Yet did not those dogs repine. They tramped and vagabondized
and reposed in the sun and the dirt; they grew very hairy
and very dirty and very hungry. But they said they were
never hungrier than they would have been had they remained in
Good Society, and spent their days hustling for fleas, which, they
said, was on the whole an advantage, as it was much less awful
to be idle and hungry than to work one’s life out for others and
be hungry all the same; and as for Public Opinion, why, to be
able to snooze in the sunshine, was worth any amount of Public
Opinion that left one’s stomach insolvent. They also became
covered with vermin, which the flea-covered and respectable
dogs of Canisville shuddered at; but the vagabond dogs said
that carrying vermin was not half as burdensome or half as
injurious to the health as carrying fleas; and as for getting their
living without work, why, the Monstrous Fleas did no work at
all and were monstrously respectable, and <i>they</i> were going to be
respectable too; all which reasoning the pious dogs said was
Sophistry, and tended to lower them still further in the estimation
of the big fleas and other Good Society.</p>

<p>Verily a chaotic state of things prevailed; and to the few sensible
dogs that ever and anon bobbed up from out-of-the way
places to bark a bark of protest, and then sink into oblivion or
be stoned out of town, all things seemed upside down.</p>

<p>But as there never was a time in all the world’s history when
to the Apologist Philosophers of the times things that were were
not right, even so at this chaotic time in Canisville there arose
the usual Apologist Philosophers who took things as they were,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span>

and out of them built a wonderful economic philosophy most
beautiful to behold, the only trouble with which was that whenever
anyone of the few sensible dogs would come out of his hole
of hiding and prod it with a little weapon called Common Sense,
the whole elaborate system would collapse and drop into dust.
Wherefore the Apologist Philosophers were aggrieved, and
appealed to the Authorities to make it a Felony for any unpopular
dog to go about prodding philosophical systems with Common
Sense, or to have about him any Common Sense, which
was, they said, a carrying of concealed weapons.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_065.jpg" alt="Illustration: WALKED ON THEIR FORE FEET AND THE TIPS OF THEIR NOSES." width="500" height="412" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>These Apologist Philosophers were singular creatures and insufferably
self-conceited, because they had “got on in the world”
as they called it; that is, they were all lucky dogs who had
managed to get fat by lying in wait for and catching what they

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>

called “Chances,”&mdash;that is, stray scraps of meat&mdash;and by
always speaking a good word for the big fleas, who rewarded them by
giving them a few of their fellow dogs to eat. Many of them made their
faces smooth, and tied around their necks white bands called “Chokers,”
which gave them a singular appearance of which they were very vain.
But their most singular distinguishment was that they wore opaquely
green spectacles and walked on their fore feet and the tips of their
noses, with their hind legs and tails in the air. This uncommon way
of walking enabled them, they said, to get a view of earthly things
totally different from that obtainable by the ordinary degraded way
of going on all fours, and enabled them more distinctly to see things
<i>as they appeared</i>, which was, they said, the philosophical method, as
contra-distinguished from the low, vulgar, altogether despicable and
ought-to-be-prohibited Common Sense method of seeing things <i>as they
were</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="Illustration: HANDED OUT ‘PROVERBS’ TO OTHER DOGS." width="434" height="500" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>The habit of these dogs was to promenade abroad by moonless
and starless night and “observe” through their opaquely green
spectacles, and then gather together by day in what they called
a “School,” where, secluded from noise and light and air, they
boiled down their observations and ran them into moulds, the
results of which operation they called “Maxims,” “Apothegms”

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>

and “Proverbs” which when cold they handed out to other
dogs to hawk about in the public places as free gifts to all dogs
to hang up in the chambers of their memories.</p>

<p>This Proverb Foundry, the big fleas said, was an excellent
Institution and was worthy of support as it did a vast amount
of Good; for it provided good things for dogs everywhere to
put in their mouths, which, as food was scarce, was a Blessed
Charity, and, moreover, by giving the dogs plenty to do mumbling
these Proverbs and Maxims over and over in their mouths,
kept them out of the mischief of thinking, and preserved their
minds in a wholesome state of imbecility which was conducive
to Social Order and the Stability of Institutions.</p>

<p>These wise-appearing philosophers, seeing that bones were
scarce and dogs many, urged upon every dog the importance of
getting ahead of every other dog, by remembering that “The
early bird gets the first worm.” Seeing that in a crowd of
struggling dogs, all the strong and lusty ones came to the front
and uppermost, they made that all right by inventing the heartless
motto for the guidance of the unscrupulous, “There’s plenty
of room at the top.” Observing that just through the gap in
the fence there is food for five dogs which one hundred and fifty
are biting and tearing to get at, they encouraged the dogs to
bear in mind that “Success in life comes only by push and
enterprise.” Having noted that he who gobbled up his meat
the fastest got most into his inside in the same time, they urged
them to racing speed by the proverbs, “Time is money,” “Procrastination
is the thief of time,” and “Hurry Up is the fastest
horse.” Noticing that when anyone throws a scrap of meat to
a crowd of hungry dogs, the one which is first and smartest gets
it, they put the rule for such cases thus: “Opportunity once
gone never returns.” Having themselves got on by carefully
watching when other dogs threw away stale and mouldy meat
that was not exceedingly well worth eating, and hoarding the
same in sly holes and corners, they glorified such mean conduct
by saying, “Frugality is the Mother of Wealth;” and when

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>

they denied their hungry stomachs a scrap in order to have a
larger hoard, they erected their mean stinginess into a Philosophy
of Life by remarking that “A Penny saved is a Penny
Earned.”</p>

<p>And so on and so on. In a thousand ways they taught that
getting on in the world is by “carving one’s way,” “compelling
success,” biting, scratching, crowding, knocking down and
trampling on your fellows; and they taught that <i>only the winner
in the race</i> is to be congratulated on his efforts; that he who
grabs and gets the bone is the one rightly entitled to it; and
that all who run and fall, and all who grab and miss, should be
voted immoral and sent to perdition.</p>

<p>And never a one of them ever made a proverb or a maxim
that had in it the remotest suggestion that there might be any
other way for dogs to live and be happy, save that by which
they were now so miserably perishing; for, as aforesaid, they
were great philosophers.</p>

<p>NOW as soon as the Apologist Philosophers and their Proverb Foundry
arose it was as though they had opened the doors of a Bottomless Pit
where were confined an infinite host of Arisers; for from that time on
there arose, and arose, and arose an endless succession of until-then
unknown and needless

Chaos Menders who came

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>

forth equipped with moral saws and hammers and jack planes
and set up shop all over Canisville and put out big flaring signs
setting forth that all manner of Moral and Spiritual Cobbling
and Repairing was done there on the shortest notice; special
attention being given to the Production of Public Virtue amongst
dogs, by a large corps of operators, in the highest degree skilled
in the art of fitting all sorts, sizes and qualities of dogs to Standard
Moral Measurement, by the use of the latest improved and
perfected machinery, warranted to lengthen, shorten, flatten,
puff out, square up, round off, expand or compress as required.
Also Corrupt Trees carefully trained and made to bear the best
of Good Fruit; thorns made to bear grapes, and thistles to
bring forth figs; all under the able superintendency of their
various agents.</p>

<p>First, there arose divers well-meaning dogs of prophets who
imagined they could restore the fighting, squabbling community
to a state of decency by schooling the dogs into a habit of compelling
their brains to sever all relationship and connection with
their stomachs.</p>

<p>So when they were ready with their Plan they sent one into
the Public Place, crying, “Behold now, this fighting and bad
temper is all wrong; ye ought to deal kindly with one another.
Lo! I come to proclaim peace.”</p>

<p>And an infidel dog said, “How wilt thou bring peace when
there are more hungry dogs than bones?”</p>

<p>And the prophet said, “Let us bear with one another; let us
resolutely put away from us all malice and evil thoughts, and
be kindly affectioned one to another; and when one of us has
found a bone, let not the other one cast covetous and hungry
eyes upon it, but let him meekly bear his lot; and when his
belly rumbles through emptiness, and he be tempted to rush
upon his neighbor’s bone, let him put up a little prayer to
the Providence which hath wisely ordained our several lots, and
howl a little hymn thus:</p>

<p>“This, my canine brethren, is all that we need&mdash;the spirit of
meekness, resignation and contentment. Think, my beloved
brethren, of all the glorious prospects that lie beyond this vale
of tears, when, if we have been very humble and contented, and
have not barked at the upper classes, nor scoffed at the well-paid
ministers of the fleas’ gospel, we shall trot the streets of
the New Canisville where the best food lies around in the greatest
profusion, and poor dogs hunger no more, neither thirst
any more.”</p>

<p>“And,” said a sceptic dog, “what shall we do for grub on
earth until we reach the grubful Canaan?”</p>

<p>“My brother,” said the prophet, “thou must pray for grace
to be content.”</p>

<p>Now, when the Church of the Fleas heard that there was a
very holy dog of a prophet gone down amongst the wicked and
discontented canines to preach unto them the doctrine of present
contentment and future bellyfuls, they gathered themselves
together in a great Praise Convention to give thanks and rejoice
for the new Star of Hope that had risen on the land, and a Holy
One, a Maker of long prayers and short wages, arose and addressed
them.</p>

<p>The Honorable One a Maker of long prayers and short wages
was a smooth and influential lay flea, who ran a large blood
suckery six days of the week, and on the other a large snivelling
prayery, and was reputed to be very rich in grace, but much
richer in this world’s wealth, and was world-noted for his stinginess
towards the dogs he drew his life blood from, and the
prodigality of his gifts to churches and charities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>There was a very queer peculiarity about his eyes: One of
them was turned permanently downward towards the earth,
and was a very keen, bright eye of high microscopic power,
which restlessly scanned every object, and by long practice had
grown able to discern with a marvellous infallibility certain dirty
looking little blood spots called pennies. This eye was what was
known as his six-days-a-week eye, and was so powerfully developed
that no matter how small these spots were, nor how
deeply hidden&mdash;even deep down at the bottom of and beneath a
hundred feet of dirt&mdash;he could see them and he would never
rest until he had uncovered them, and gathered them in with
his marvellously acquisitive blood sucker.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>
<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_072.jpg" alt="Illustration: THE HONORABLE ONE." width="200" height="261" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>His other eye was known as his seventh-day eye, and was a very keen,
bright eye of high telescopic power, which by persistent straining and
practice had bulged outward and upward towards Heaven, and had developed
a marvellous capacity for seeing mansions in the skies, harps and golden
crowns of glory and immortality, laid up in particular for the Honorable
One a Maker of long prayers and short wages.</p>

<p>So that what with the present riches his six-days-a-week eye
enabled his marvellously acquisitive blood sucker to pick up,
and the prospective riches his seventh-day eye enabled him to
see was his, he was very wealthy indeed, very sleek and exceedingly
well contented&mdash;as any one so well fixed for both worlds
ought to be.</p>

<p>He said: “Brethren of the most ancient and honorable Church
of the Suckers, it is evident that the great problem of sin and
wickedness amongst the poor is about to be solved. I confess
that, to me, the state of the poor has been for years past, a great
burden of anxiety upon my heart, and a subject of agonizing

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>

prayer. I have remarked their pinched features, their hungry
jaws, their woe-begone condition, and I have endeavored as far
as in me lies, to alleviate their hard lot. What shall be done to
lift them up? Let us remember that they are <i>of our own blood</i>.
The poor brutes on which I live excite my compassion more
than I can tell, and I have done everything I know of to lessen
the hardness of their lot. I encourage my lady flea and our flea-lets&mdash;than
whom there are not more holy ones between here and
the seventh heaven&mdash;to go down and teach them. They take
little tracts to them, showing them, in the most beautiful manner,
how by more toil, more thrift, more temperance, more
economy of time and little retrenchments in sleep and <i>luxuries</i>,
and the lopping off here and there of sinful indulgences, and
crucifixion of various ungodly lusts, they can with the help of
God, come up to fatness, and even to a sleek condition. They
have showed them that “Where there’s a will, there’s ALWAYS
a way” to success in life, and they have shown them by various
shining examples, how ANY dog may, by patient perseverance,
lift himself out of the condition of being a blood-yielding dog
and come up by Transformation into that of being an honored
sucker himself and deacon of a church. And to encourage
them, I have even sometimes remitted five per cent. of <i>the blood
they owe me</i>. But nothing seems to come of it. They seem
just as thriftless as ever and as full of vice. And really their
idleness and shiftlessness cause me serious alarm as I perceive
that their daily yield of blood is decreasing and I have suffered
much loss. And brethren, no doubt I voice your experience.
We know that godliness among these poor is economically
profitable. A pious, contented dog works more faithfully than
an ungodly one; and there is infinitely more pleasure in going
to collect our monthly dues from amongst the pious, sober,
well behaved and godly dogs, than amongst those who by their
wicked idleness, insobriety and insolent barkings, give us
trouble and anxiety. Let us remember that nice Scripture
which says, ‘Godliness is profitable unto all things, having the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>

promise not only of the life that now is, but of that which is to
come.’ Let us then be not only good but wise, and not only
support this good prophet in his work, but set apart others unto
the good work; and let us call them City Missionaries. Will
some one now move that we pass ’round the hat? And let the
collection be a good big one brethren, for, recollect, this is to
send the gospel to the poor, and ‘he that giveth to the poor
lendeth to the Lord,’ and the Lord always pays good interest,
brethren, good measure, pressed down, shaken together and
running over. So that we shall by this present sacrifice be
eternal gainers and come out at the large end of the horn.”</p>

<p>And it was so. And they made up a big pot of money for the
missionaries; and they stroked their paunches affectionately
and departed, feeling that God ought to be very much obliged
to them for having condescended to think on his poor.</p>

<p>And from that time on there was reported “great success” in
the preaching of the Gospel of Content. At the end of the year
the Church of the Suckers got together, and had the prophets
tell them of the good work done during the year. And the
good prophets made various long reports of their work. They
had written down in books called “diaries” how many visits
they had made among the poor dogs; how many they had induced
by exhortation, to give up their fighting and quarreling;
how many had thus been brought to sit in rows in certain bare-looking
gospel houses called “Missions,” and howl out certain
noises called “hymns,” and to declare at the end of meetings
that they had “got religion” and “found grace” to bear their
hunger and all their miseries, and even to put on a visage and a
look that betokened that they rather enjoyed hunger and poverty
and hankered for more. But the reports always wound up with
the statement, that how much soever of good <i>had</i> been done, it
was as nothing to the good that remained to <i>be</i> done; that the
“fields were white unto the harvest,” and praying that “more
laborers be sent into the harvest,” and, finally, that although
they had got quite a number of hungry and poverty-stricken

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>

dogs to enter the ranks of the contented saints, the vast multitude
were still discontented and quarrelsome and wicked, and
would not come to the “Mission,” but loafed about the streets
on Sunday, blind to their “privileges,” and deaf to the “gracious
call.” And what was even more sad and pitiable, these loafers,
who would not be gathered under the wing of the new gospel
hen, not only made a mock at sin, but had made grievous faces
at the missionaries. Then the speakers congratulated the “mission
society” on the “good” they had done and urged the missionaries
to bear their hard trials with meekness, and to put forth
“greater efforts” in the future.</p>

<p>THEN did the numerous Chaos Straighteners and
Moral and Spiritual Cobblers, seeing that they
had the hearty appreciation of the Church of the
Fleas, in their efforts to spiritually “save” the bodily
starved dogs, feel much encouraged, and began
to devise how they might improve, strengthen and
enlarge their saving methods. Having religiously gone out of
their way to coax and beguile the poor, depraved and rib-stripped
dogs into becoming good&mdash;though having religiously remained <i>in</i>
their way while all the fleas, big and little, had depraved them&mdash;it
was naturally easy to go one step further and supplement their
beguilements with a little coercion. They reasoned that if it
was right to hold nice moral persuasives to the dogs’ noses to
draw them onward and upward, it could not be wrong to club
them in the same direction from behind. They said the “Getting
to Heaven” was the main thing, and that even if a dog had
to be taken by the tail and flung over the wall thereof, and
landed inside with a flop that shook his bowels out, it was infinitely
more merciful to him than allowing him to go easily to
Hell.</p>

<p>So they divided themselves into groups and squads for the
purpose of surrounding the dogs. To the churchy squads
was assigned the duty of standing in a little narrow, dingy and
very uninviting moral alley-way, which they euphemistically

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>

called the “Way to Heaven,” and with call whistles and Jews-harps
and kazoos calling the dogs’ attention to pretty pictures
at the far end of the alley-way, representing green fields and
flowing streams, and big piles of very meaty bones, and fat and
full dogs snoozing thereby, and other scenes supposed to be
attractive to starving dogs. Another churchy band strewed
lollipops, drops of gravy and other seducements along the alley-way.</p>

<p>These two bands called themselves “The Society of Strenuous
Endeavorists,” because they “endeavored” to cajole and
persuade flea-bitten and depraved dogs to go up the dingy alley-way.</p>

<p>Other squads planted themselves here and there at various
strategic points, where dogs were likely to break away, and
“endeavored” by more or less violent methods, to turn the
faces of the dogs towards the dingy alley-way and force them,
by goads and prods and clubs, to be persuaded by the Endeavorists
and Lollipoppers. These squads proudly called themselves
by various distinguishing names, such as the “Go to
Church or be Clubbed Society;” “The Yanking Dogs Heaven-ward
Association;” “The Order of Holy Whackers and
Thwackers;” “The Compulsory Holiness Society;” “The A.
A. U. S. G. B. &amp; L,” which being interpreted, means “The
Association for the Advancement of the Use of Sanctification
Generating Billies and Locusts;” “The Society for the Promotion
of Pious Poverty;” “The Society for the Suppression
of Natural Consequences and the Sundering of Cause and
Effect;” “The Gulp-a-Camel-and-Gag-at-a-Gnat Society,” and
the “Dog Souling and Healing Association.”</p>

<p>These squads were all officered by fat and comfortable mongrel
creatures, one third dog, one third flea, and the rest monkey,
whose qualifications for the headship thereof were that while
young they had graduated from a certain College of the fleas established
to teach the doctrine that virtue in dogs had no relation
to their living carcases, but could be arbitrarily produced in any

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>

dog by thrusting him into a certain conventional moral mould,
and thumping, walloping, pounding and hammering him until
he fit it. After several years of training in this School where they
saw thousands of dogs broken and smashed and distorted, <i>but
never a one made to fit</i>, and they themselves had laboriously
tried to make dogs fit the mould, but never did, they were examined
as to their proficiency in the science and art of achieving
moral failure; and as to their belief in the Attainability of the
Impossible; and if the examination was satisfactory they signed
a solemn declaration that they were true believers in that self-same
blessed doctrine.</p>

<p>Whereupon the Principals opened their heads to see if their
brains were <i>really</i> full of that doctrine, and if so they poured
therein a ladleful of an antiseptic compound called “Compound
Concentrated Quintessence of Pig-Headed Bourbonism” that
was warranted to keep sound and immovably fix that doctrine
in their brains all their lives; then they hermetically sealed up
the opening against the entrance of any displacing idea, and
turned the creature abroad upon the earth with a diploma certifying
that the holder thereof had been duly treated, and had had
his brain properly embalmed, and was thereafter incapable of
receiving any other idea if he lived a million years.</p>

<p>Now, all these gangs and squads had very “encouraging success”
in their work. That is to say the <i>success</i> was not much&mdash;in truth
it was very little&mdash;but what there was of it was very <i>encouraging</i>
to them because they were incapable of perceiving failure. Not
many dogs could be induced by the Strenuous Endeavorists and
Lollipoppers to go up the dingy alley-way, and of the few who
went to the far end thereof, most returned saying that, barring
the lollipops and drops of gravy, the fullness and plenty was all
wretchedly pictorial, and the air was so heavy and stagnant,
and the surroundings so dull and dreary that they preferred to
go back and be damned hungry, rather than be “saved” hungry.
In fact they had got so used to being damned hungry that it
hurt less than the hungry “salvation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>But over the little few who stayed in the Way to Heaven the
Strenuous Endeavorists made great rejoicings; they labelled
them Spared Monuments, packed them carefully in wadding and
toted them round to the churches of the fleas and exhibited them
as fine samples of what could be accomplished by “never wearying
in well doing,” and the Church applauded, and the Monstrous
Fleas being appealed to for help in carrying on the work,
sent down their blessing and a large fund to provide more lollipops
and gravy, and an earnest appeal to the Strenuous Endeavorists
to endeavor to devise some scheme of salvation for the
poor unfortunate dogs that ground at the Handle of their Mill,
and whose spiritual interests lay very near to their hearts.</p>

</div>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>ALL these dog-flea-monkey Virtue Compulsionists
had one peculiar delusion: They all
imagined that they were exceedingly beautiful
spiritually, and comely of complexion
morally, and resembled in moral features
a certain gloriously beautiful Person who
had lived and died above 1800 years before; about whom the
salaried barkers in the churches of the fleas were paid to bark
one day in every seven.</p>

<p>It was a practice ordained by the Church that every barker, in
the course of his regular barking, should draw on a gold and
gem-studded, framed, marble slab, a Portrait of this Personage;
for two reasons: First, to keep him in remembrance, because,
they said, he was the Blessed Founder of the Church of the
Fleas; and second, because it was obligatory both upon the
reverend barker and upon every member of the Church to be
conformed unto His Likeness, by diligently comparing themselves
with the Portrait.</p>

<p>It was a Blessed Custom, and originated thus:&mdash;The Original
Portrait was in the Holy Book that lay on the costly cushion,
drawn there by certain brave but poor and persecuted dogs who
knew and loved the Original Person. Their Church in those

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span>

days was the Church of the Dogs, and was a very small and
obscure church that was set up in out-of-the-way, damp and
mouldy dens and caves and holes and corners of the earth;
because the Church of the Fleas of those days had crucified the
Founder of it, and did cruelly hunt and persecute and kill the
dogs that belonged to it. But those dogs did the more love his
memory, and did day by day copy out his Portrait from the
Original and conform themselves to it.</p>

<p>But after a time, when they that knew the Founder were gathered
into the heavenly garner, and there arose a succession of
dogs that knew him not, the Church of the Dogs <i>went acourting</i>
unto the respectable Church of the Fleas and asked to be
united in Holy Wedlock unto it. And the Church of the Fleas
corrupted with respectability the Church of the Dogs, and the
dogs sold their brand-new religion to the fleas whose gods had
become dilapidated and <i>worm-eaten</i> for lack of fresh paint.
Whereupon the Church of the Fleas threw their rotten old gods
on the rubbish heap, and adopted the worship of the Wonderful
Personage and the practice of drawing his Portrait. But
the practice of copying it from the Original in the Big Book was
in time discarded, because many of the fleas, when called on by
the barkers to compare themselves with the Portrait, said it
reproached them, being too good, and made them ugly by
comparison, and the conforming themselves thereto was too expensive
and inconvenient. And when the barker insisted on
compliance with the custom, they said he was an impertinent
barker and didn’t know his place; and they called on the dogs
to cast him out and worry him to death. Which terrible example
and warning caused the succeeding barkers to be pertinent and
know their places, and bark according to the desire of the fleas&mdash;<i>which
they had carefully done ever since</i>.</p>

<p>So no more was the Seventh-daily copy copied from the Original
but was copied from the preceding Seventh-daily copy&mdash;which
gave the employers far less dissatisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>But the barkers, diligently keeping the fear of the fleas and
the fate of the cast out barkers before them, fell gradually into
the habit of here and there adding to the Portrait a feature or
two of the eminent fleas that sat and smiled before them; and
as this gentle flattery of the fleas was received by them with
great favor, the barkers&mdash;who had by this time very perspicaciously
discerned on which side their bread was buttered&mdash;were
encouraged; and soon the Portrait in no wise resembled the
Original. But it gave very great satisfaction to the fleas, who
found themselves growing more and more like unto the Blessed
Person whom they worshipped; and the barkers found their
basketfuls of meat growing ever larger as their reward; insomuch
that in the latter days such barkers as Tee de Little Wit
Blatherskite&mdash;who drew the Seventh-daily Portrait with great
skill, and filled it fuller of flea features than any other barker&mdash;got
very great basketfuls, and were held in the highest honor by
the most eminent suckers, who said they were good dogs that
they would not part with at any price. Therefore it was that
when all the dog-flea-monkey dog coercionists and heads of the
various Physical-Force Holiness Societies sat in the Church of
the Fleas and looked upon the Features and Form of the Portrait,
they lifted up their mouths to Heaven and gave loud thanks
to God that they were the exact counterparts of the Ever Blessed
Person, for their ugly mugs and ignorantly brutal and fanatical
eyes were just like his.</p>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>EMINENT over all the crowd of Morality Cobblers and Dog Soulers and
Healers who sat in the Church of the Fleas and looked upon the Portrait,
was one whose brain had been particularly well embalmed and hermetically
sealed against the entrance of any new idea. This was Lovely Anthony
Thumpem Clubstock. He was a great admirer of the Portrait; and he went
daily into the church to hold Holy Communion with himself before it.
And thus he communed: “That is a most excellent likeness of the Blessed
Personage for it is <i>just like me</i>. Like me, he was the All-Righteous,
and, like me, he had but one desire&mdash;to suppress the vice of the
world; but he lacked method, and unfortunately had not <i>me</i> with him
to give him points. Oh, if it had pleased God to have sent me on earth
along with him, what a team we should have made; he with his genius, and
I with my method; why, we would have covered the earth

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span>

with righteousness, even as the waters cover the sea. Of course
he had his faults&mdash;as who has not? He was too much inclined
to Mercy and Forgiveness and all that sort of thing. He had
too much heart, and it ran away with him. Had I been with him&mdash;which,
alas, I was not&mdash;I should have been a corrective.
Heart might have been less objectionable in his time than now,
but to-day nothing but the Strong Hand and the Heavy Club
can drive the degenerate dogs of this day to Virtue and Righteousness;
and I believe that were he on earth to-day his good
sense would approve a sterner policy of cleansing the earth of
sin. Dogs to-day are so fearfully depraved, so very vile, such
dreadful despisers of Holy Religion, such malignant scoffers at
our reverend salaried barkers, and are so viciously and stubbornly
averse to going to heaven, that were they to be let
alone, or pushed with mere kindness, they would become utterly
evil and corrupt the earth.</p>

<p>“He seems to have had no nose for nastiness nor eye for discerning
indecency. But I have a splendid buzzard smeller that
detecteth the faintest taint afar off, and an eagle eye that
instantaneously discerneth indecency, even where it is not.
He lacked the natural taste to dabble with filth and scratch
around cesspools. But I am not so. I with my little mop and
pail will clean the earth of evil for him. I will suppress Vice
and make the earth so lovely that were he to come back he
would grasp my paw and say, ‘Well, done Good and Lovely
Anthony; thou art unique; thou hast faithfully walloped and
larruped the erring dogs of earth back into my Fold of Love;
thou hast performed the hitherto impossible job of hammering
virtue through their hides, and opening with a club the buds of
Holiness in their hearts; henceforth thou art promoted; I will
make thee Clubber Plenipotentiary to Hell, which no doubt
thou canst reclaim for me.’”</p>

<p>And Lovely Anthony, having sharpened his buzzard smeller
and polished his eagle eye, went and easily gathered together a
gang of true believers in the Gospel of the Club&mdash;for the land

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>

was full of them, brain-embalmed and pig-headedly Bourbonish
like himself&mdash;and he called them the “Society for the Suppression
of Vice,” and said unto them, “Brethren, go ye out into
the highways and the byways, and wheresoever ye espy any
depraved dog, hale him before the Suppressors, the police dogs.
But be very tender with the fleas that are on him, for they are
our life. Let your zeal for God effervesce above all considerations.
If any depraved and vicious dog hide himself away
where it is difficult to get at him, remember that his suppression
is the <i>supreme aim</i> of all your efforts, and act accordingly.
If ye cannot lay hold of him openly and boldly, then transform
yourselves, and garb yourselves like him and act in all respects
as a vicious dog like him, to gain his confidence and draw him
from his hole. Stick not at a lie or two, or at any breach of the
law to trepan him, or at any damnable and vicious thing which
may be necessary to suppress Vice and promote Virtue, for the
bringing in of the Kingdom of Heaven is of such tremendous
consequence, that if we have to borrow all the ordnance and
weaponry of Hell to do it with, we will. Our motto is, ‘The
End always justifies the Means,’ and when the vice of all dogs
shall have been suppressed and the earth shall be pure again, ye
shall all be forgiven.</p>

<p>“If a dog be hungry and howl, suppress his howl, for his noise
is disturbing to the repose of the fleas; if he throw covetous
glances at any scrap of food that is not his by gracious permission
of the fleas, thump him, for covetousness is sin against
God and the fleas. If he be measly and have scabs for want of
nourishment, smite him severely, and tell him his scabs are an
offense to respectable fleas, and such exhibitions are by law
prohibited. If by reason of poverty he be ignorant, hit him a
whack on the skull, and tell him that Ignorance is the parent of
Vice, and cannot be permitted at all. If he be amusing himself
with low and disreputable games, larrup him heavily and point
him to the Church where God has provided an infinitely
better Feast for the Soul than games, and cease not to batter

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span>

him until ye have driven him there. And, finally, if he excuse
himself that he is plundered and poor and wretched, and must
do as he does, smite him on the mouth for those wicked excuses,
for they are blasphemy.”</p>

<p>So the Suppressors of Vice went out, abundantly armed with
clubs, and equipped with all manner of disguises and dog-catching
devices and traps and snares; and they found many dogs
that were measly and scabby, and were ignorant, and had dim
moral eyesight, and stole, and amused themselves with low
games and excused themselves. And the Suppressors exercised
all their diligence, and all their arts and devices to suppress and
catch those dogs; but the only effect they produced was to
cause the dogs to use diligence and art and device to get out of
their way and into dark corners.</p>

</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Then did Lovely Anthony get mad and go out himself to set
them an Example, and did set wonderfully complicated traps
by which he had great dog-catching success. He would walk
about pretending to be a scabby dog, and very ignorant and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span>

blind, and would amuse himself with low games, and would
spread paper Laws before the dogs, and in their sight jump
through them and burst great holes in them and play devil
generally, all in order to encourage and tempt the vicious dogs
to come out of their hiding places and do likewise, when he
would suddenly pounce on them and hold them until he had
called the police dogs, who would soundly thump and larrup
them.</p>

<p>All this kept Lovely Anthony the Dog Catcher, and his
assistant Dog Catchers, very busy and wonderfully well pleased
and satisfied with themselves; but as the thumping and larruping
never filled the poor dogs’ stomachs or lifted a solitary flea
off their bodies, the dogs were only made worse; for in addition
to all their other woes, they had the awful affliction of him and
his on top. The only difference it made was that it stimulated
the cunning of the depraved dogs who grew more expert at
hiding away and fooling them.</p>

<p>As to Lovely Anthony the Dog Catcher, his brain having
been properly embalmed and eternally fixed, he only waxed
more zealous in his efforts; and he prophesied, with all the certainty
of one that knew, that sometime during next Eternity
all bad and vicious dogs will have been suppressed, and all
others walloped into loving God; and all the relations between
dogs and fleas will have been harmonized according to the eternal
rights of fleas to suck blood.</p>

<p>NOW when the Church of the Fleas had diligently

awhile, they said one to another, “Lo! The Kingdom

light. Now will it not be so hard to persuade
dogs to come to the Means of Grace. No longer shall we
have merely our labor and sweat for our pains. Now shall we
gather in the erring by wholesale, for with Lovely Anthony to
twist their tails for us they will more easily see the error of their

reverently inquire of him when it would be convenient to him to
come down and be made a god of. And Anthony the Dog Catcher
was graciously pleased to appoint a day, and they brought

their Great Labor Saver, the great Sin Killer and Bringer-in of
the Millennium.</p>

<p>And they put upon his head a golden crown, and in his paws
a hammer of iron and fetters of brass, crying “Hail! King of
Depravity Squelchers! With these tools shalt thou bring in the
Kingdom of Righteousness and Love!”</p>

<p>And Lovely Anthony the Dog Catcher and Depravity Squelcher
was graciously pleased with their homage, and smiled and
felt good, and held up his head; when lo! on the top thereof,
on the spot marked on human skulls by creatures called phrenologists
as the bump of Self-Conceit, there appeared an elevation
which, throbbing and swelling like unto “rising” dough,
grew and grew until it reached half a cubit in height and burst
into flower; at which wonderful moment the sun did shine
through the window full upon him. Whereupon there fell upon
the adoring barkers a great awe; and they said these signs were
Heaven’s seal set unto Lovely Anthony’s patent new method of
bringing in the Kingdom of Heaven upon earth.</p>

<p>Then did the salaried barkers send around to the Monstrous
Fleas and pray them to come along at once and see the great
and divinely appointed Sin Killer and pay him their worshipful
respects. But the Monstrous Fleas returned answer that
they had a great work to do, and could not come around;
that they exceedingly regretted that they were just then so
excessively busy filling their paunches with blood, and trying
to hold themselves up to the requisite standard of tight plethora,
that they could not come down, and that they sent their highest
regards to their Heaven-sent friend and Society Saviour, with
their loftiest approval of and profoundest admiration for his new
method of holding bad, depraved and vicious dogs with their
noses towards Virtue and the open church doors&mdash;which was,
they said, absolutely necessary to the Safety of Investments and
the Regularity of Dividends, to say nothing of the saving of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>

poor dogs’ precious and immortal souls which lay very near to
their hearts&mdash;and that if the Lovely Anthony could spare a few
moments and step around to see them as they sat about the Tank,
why they would be very happy to worship him for a few
moments.</p>

<p>And it was so. And Lovely Anthony did step around to see
them, and the Monstrous Fleas inclined their heads as they
drank, and gave him the assurances of their most distinguished
consideration and promises of unlimited contributions of wealth
to his great and noble work. And Anthony was much pleased
with their homage and the blessed evidences of their love for
him; and the elevation on the top of his head went up another
half cubit and bore several flowers.</p>

<p>And the Monstrous Fleas showed him to the dogs that did
grind at the Handle; who did droop their heads and tremble
with awe of him, and make solemn resolutions within themselves
to be good and nevermore think evil of the Monstrous
Fleas that had been divinely appointed to drink the blood they
had been divinely appointed to grind out for them.</p>

<p>AMONGST the multitude that did gather to the worship of Saint
Anthony the Lovely was one of the many Chaos Menders. He also had a
well embalmed brain, and had but one eye which had the singular optical
property of turning every visible object in the universe into the image
of a poor, suffering little bow-wow. And when he smelt the incense and
heard the hymns of adoration and saw the worshipful prosternation to
Lovely Anthony, the bile of envy suffused his noble features and turned
his little bow-wow-seeing solitary eye a green of emerald hue, that
grew more green with envy with every moment’s duration of the adoration
of Anthony. And one of the adoring barkers, who was less intent and
absorbed in his devotions than the rest, observing him, said unto
him:</p>

<p>“Brother Elder Berry, why are thy features suffused; and why
is thine orb of vision so green? Art thou in an unsanitary
state? Art thou sick? Hast thou a Crisis? Tell me, for thou
alarmest me!”</p>

<p>And the One-eyed Elder Berry answered and said: “I am
not sick; I am not in an unsanitary state; I am only grieved;
grieved for the foolishness of these adoring simpletons in worshiping

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>

this illogical Anthony Thumpem Clubstock. Why all
this idiotic fuss over his tom-fool trying to reform hardened old
dogs who are eternally fixed in the ways of Vice and Sin? No
one but a stark, stamping, staring fool would try to untwist a
twisted old apple tree with screws and levers and chains. None
but a supreme fool would try it. The only wise way is to train
the little, growing, pliable sapling and shape it exactly as you
want it. That is Wisdom’s way; that is <i>the</i> way; that is <i>my</i>
way; that is the only adorable way; and were this assembly
wise they would now be worshipping ME, the Sin Preventer,
and not paying idolatrous adoration to this strange god of a Dog
Catcher, for I am the only original and genuine Sin Curer; all
others are bogus and counterfeit; my name is blown in on the
bottle, and see that you get it, and take no other; protected by
letters patent, and all infringers will be prosecuted to the full
extent of the law.”</p>

<p>“And what wouldst thou do, dear Elder Berry?” asked the
barker. “Thou speakest but in figure.”</p>

<p>“Do?” replied the One-eyed, “Seest thou not, thou two-eyed
barker, that it is the depraved <i>little</i> bow-wows that need
the Vice-Suppressor’s care rather than the old and hardened
ones? Keep the young and tender ones from going wrong and
there’ll be no old dogs going wrong, and no Vice to suppress.
Let me trace the Genesis of Vice. I have applied mine Eye
to the matter, and I find it begins with the horrible cruelty of
those depraved and hungry dogs sending their little ones abroad
from the parental kennels into the streets to scratch for bones
and scraps. No old dogs with any heart would be so wicked as
to drive out those tender and helpless little dears thus to
scratch. It is mere hungry greed on their parents’ part; it is
immoral; it is cruel; it is destructive to Society in every way.
The little bow-wows thus get acquainted early with the wickedness
of the streets; and in the fierce struggle of life their tender
health, both of body and mind, is destroyed. Their dear little
bodies are fatigued, and their desires after better things are

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span>

chilled, benumbed and destroyed. Thus have they no mind to
walk betimes in Wisdom’s ways and mind Religion young. And,
more awful still, their constitutions being early undermined,
they grow up puny, feeble, ill nourished and thin blooded; so
that they are not properly capable of doing their full duty at
the Handle of the Mill or of yielding their due amount of blood
to the fleas God has appointed them to carry.</p>

<p>“This greed of their parents ought to be&mdash;must be&mdash;curbed,
and this cruelty to the little bow-wows and wrong to Society
brought to an end. Behold the fleas, now; <i>they</i> set a beautiful
example; <i>they</i> do not greedily send out <i>their</i> little ones to help
suck blood; <i>they</i> protect, nurture, watch over them, educate
them and give them all advantages until they are big enough
and strong enough to suck for themselves; and the consequence
is they grow up to be honored and respected members of
Society. All this hath mine eye seen.</p>

<p>“Here is the root of the evil. Now, this Lovely Anthony
strikes not at the <i>root</i> of the evil; he strikes only at the <i>fruit</i>;
and therein he is off his head and far removed from his base;
and therefore are these barkers and Monstrous Fleas off <i>their</i>
heads and far removed from <i>their</i> bases, in worshiping him.
But when they see my method they will worship <i>me</i> instead, if
they know a good thing when they see it.”</p>

<p>And when the adoration of Lovely Anthony was over, Brother
Elder Berry, the One-eyed, and his friend the barker, did consult
together, and did call in several of the other barkers to the
consultation; and the proposed method of the One-eyed found
favor in their eyes, and they helped him to form a Gang of Saviors,
which they baptized with the name of “The Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Little Bow-wows.” And they spake
unto Pup McPoodle, and he gave police dogs unto the One-eyed
Elder Berry, that he might have power to club and batter
and hammer the heads of all such as might seek to prevent him
preventing cruelty. And the Monstrous Fleas, hearing of this
most praiseworthy attempt to improve the blood of dogs, and to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span>

add more vigor to those who turned the Handle, sent him their
most sincere invocation of God’s blessing upon him, and the
assurance of their most earnest desire to co-operate with him, by
large donations of wealth, or any other form of assistance they
might be able to render.</p>

<p>And the One-eyed Elder Berry and his gang did much infest
the streets of Canisville; and they picked up many little bow-wows
that did scratch in the streets, and spake austerely to
them, and told them they mustn’t; and they made the little
bow-wows tell who were the wicked parents that had, because
of greed, sent them out; and they went and spake austerely
unto those parents, and told them they mustn’t; and when those
parents explained that they were very hungry and did themselves
scratch for bones and scraps all day in the streets, and
even then did not find enough to stay their hunger, and could
not appease the hunger of the little bow-wows, they rebuked
them austerely, and told them their hunger was all greed and
cruelty to the little bow-wows, to whom they owed more affection
and duty, and that really they mustn’t any more. So they
made the little bow-wows stay within their holes and corners,
where they hungered and perished, for the old bow-wows could
not maintain them. Whereupon the little fleas and the big fleas
and the Monstrous Fleas did give the One-eyed Elder Berry a
hint that this kind of prevention of cruelty was not working
well, and tended to diminish the supply of dogs and bring to
pass the prevention of Dividends&mdash;which was a prevention
they could not sanction under any consideration at all.</p>

<p>Therefore the One-eyed Elder Berry did desist from catching
the poor little starving bow-wows in the street, in the day time;
and his vision of being one day set on high and worshiped, as
was Anthony the Dog Catcher, grew dim. But certain of his
gang advised him that certain moderately plump and comfortable
little bow-wows had been seen going at night to certain places,
to dance for a few minutes for a good basketful of meat, to
amuse certain of the Canisvillians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“Ah! Say ye so?” exclaimed the One-eyed Berry, as his one
eye bulged and lit up with the phosphorescent glow of hope of
immortal fame, “dancing by little bow-wows, did ye say? Why,
here is Sin, concentrated Iniquity, hydraulically pressed,
rammed and condensed Wickedness, enough, under any favorably
accidental expansion, to poison the whole moral atmosphere
of Canisville, and kill us all. And to think that these
tender and immature bow-wows are set to enact it all.”</p>

<p>And he diligently inquired where this evil might be found;
and they told him, and he hied himself thither, and sat and
saw the little bow-wows dance; and his eye bulged with
horror as he perceived that the little bow-wows loved the dance,
and were delighted with the large reward for the little work,
which enabled them to take more to the kennels of their parents
in one night than the parents could scratch up in the streets
in a month.</p>

<p>And his horror grew still more when he found by visits to
their kennels that these parent dogs were having much easier
times than other dogs, through the efforts of these little bow-wows,
which, on their part, grew plump and well-to-do.</p>

<p>This, said he, was cruelty of the cruellest sort, to turn these
poor little tender innocents out <i>at night</i>&mdash;and worse&mdash;<i>to dance</i>,
which was more exhausting to their vitality and&mdash;what was of
infinitely more moment&mdash;<i>their morals</i>, than any amount of
hungry scratching in the streets for bones and scraps.</p>

<p>But the parent dogs and others said it was not so; the little
bow-wows were well nourished and well sheltered and protected
from the storms and tempests, and hunger and wickedness of
the streets, and were infinitely better off than the poor unfortunate
bow-wows of the famishing wretches that did grind
at the Handle of the Mill, that were thrown into the hopper
to satisfy the blood greed of his dear friends, the Monstrous
Fleas.</p>

<p>All which failed to move him to the right or left of his righteous
determination to suppress cruelty to small bow-wows; for he

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span>

set his police dogs to prevent these little ones dancing. Which
they did.</p>

<p>And the little ones no more received good basketfuls for a
little work, and they and the parent dogs did starve in their
kennels, until compelled to go out <i>into the wicked streets</i>, and
scratch from early morning until midnight for awfully meatless
bones, or until the old dogs were compelled to fling them into
the hopper of the Mill, as a fee to the Monstrous Fleas, to be
allowed to grind and drop dead at the Handle.</p>

<p>Thus did the One-eyed Elder Berry prevent cruelty to little
bow-wows.</p>

<p>IN spite, however, of the efforts of the mighty crowd
of Vice Suppressors, Sin Killers, and Depravity
Squelchers, putters down of this, that and t’other,
and preventers of t’other, that and this, the depravity
of the dogs went on increasing. The poor dogs were
harassed on all sides and suffered a grand battue,
but the Church and the salaried barkers on whose
behalf the battue was undertaken, bagged very little of the
game; hundreds slipped through the well-organized ranks of
the beaters and clubbers and got themselves away to out-of-the-way
holes and corners where they perversely went down and
down and down in the depths of depravity. They had grown
utterly disheartened in the everlasting and ferocious struggle
for a living; and in spite of the good missionaries who told
them they must walk in the Fear of God, they grew reckless
and said the Fear of God fills no bellies, that the Fear of God
was all very well when you had a good pile of good victuals laid
by in the kennel, but when you hadn’t, the Fear of Hunger
was the only Fear it was incumbent upon a poor dog to fear.</p>

<p>The good missionaries were much shocked, of course, with
such manifestation of disregard for what they called “higher
things” and begged of them to read the little tract called the
“Way of Life,” but these depraved dogs did grievously and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span>

irreligiously retort that Victuals was the only “Way of Life”
they cared for, and did turn their tails and depart, and they were
no more heard of in Good Society.</p>

<p>But there were divers perverse dogs that would neither walk
in the “Way of Life” and the “Fear of God,” nor go down
in the depths of depravity. By the merest good luck they
managed to feed fairly well, and this, they said, was the only
reason why they did not become as depraved as their fellow dogs.</p>

<p>These were very philosophical dogs in their way. They
boldly declared that the foundation and nine tenths of the superstructure
of all the virtue and good conduct in the world is
<i>plenty of good honest victuals</i>; and that that particular form
of irregular conduct in dogs called Crime is neither vice nor
wickedness, necessarily, but is, mostly, Nature’s blind and
instinctive rebellion and protest against the deprivation, by Law,
of victuals and other natural rights. Therefore, said they, as
the conduct called Crime is the direct creation and result of
Law, it is very funny that the Law should disown and declare it
illegal.</p>

<p>These philosophical dogs had constructed what they called a
Conductometer, by which they illustrated the working of their
theory.</p>

<p>This was an ordinary living dog whose stomach had been made
visible through the said dog having accidentally, one day, got
in line with a thing called a “gun” in the hands of an animal
of the human species called a “Sport,” who had “touched it
off” just for fun, and blown a hole in the poor dog’s ribs.</p>

<p>This dog these philosophers found writhing in pain; and they
dragged him away and hid him to nurse and heal him.</p>

<p>And one said, “Why not utilize this Providential Opening
through which to scientifically observe the relationship between
Victuals and Virtue, about which there is so much dispute nowadays?”</p>

<p>And the proposition seemed good unto them; and it was so,
that they stretched over the aperture a transparent membrane,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>

on which they marked a graduated scale whose zero was
located at half fullness of the stomach; and they called the
instrument a “Conductometer.”</p>

<p>Into this stomach they injected, by means of a funnel, a
specially prepared, nutritious food, and by means of the scale
they observed the relationship of the dog’s behavior to the food
in his stomach.</p>

<p>Now, it was observed that when the quantity of his food was at the
zero line, he was just an ordinary dog, with just ordinary moral ideas;
but for every degree above zero he improved, and for every degree below
he deteriorated.</p>

<p>When they injected two or three above-zero degrees of food into him,
his eye brightened, and his moral perceptions grew more acute. At this
point they asked him, “What is thine opinion of the Commandment ‘Thou
Shalt not Steal?’”</p>

<div class="topspace-1"></div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="Illustration: FULL." width="374" height="500" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>And he replied “It is an excellent one; no dog ought to steal.”</p>

<p>Then they filled him up one or two more degrees, and asked
him the same question. “It is shocking to steal,” said he, “and
the dog that does not know the difference between <i>meum</i> and
<i>tuum</i> ought to be made to know it with a club.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>Then they filled him full up. And a glow of most beautiful
intelligence came into his eye; a most reposeful calm came over
his frame; a heavenly peace overspread his countenance, and
he displayed a decided propensity to piety, and an irresistible
tendency to hold forth like a fat-salaried barker, on the virtue
of Contentment with one’s earthly lot, Trust in God and the
beauties of Law and Order.</p>

<p>“What now is thine opinion of the Commandment?” they asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, the unutterable wickedness of Theft and Crime,” he replied, “it
is abominable; it is damnable; no law can be too stringent and severe
against it; and any one guilty of breaking the Law ought to be hanged,
drawn and quartered, and fed to the beasts of the field and the buzzards
and vultures of the air as a prey and as a warning to others. Oh! The
very contemplation of Crime makes me shudder; do, oh do, change the
painful subject;” and a strong spasm of pain thrilled his frame from
nose to tail.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>
<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" alt="Illustration: EMPTY." width="325" height="500" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>But when they allowed his supply of stomach furniture to run
low, the glow of most beautiful intelligence went out of his eye,
the most reposeful calm came off his frame, the heavenly peace
went off his countenance, and the propensity to hold forth, like
a fat-salaried barker, on Contentment and Trust in God, left him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>And when his supply registered one degree below zero, they
asked him “What is thine opinion of the Commandment ‘Thou
Shalt not Steal?’”</p>

<p>And he replied, absent-mindedly, “Steal? Steal? Well; it is
not right&mdash;to be caught at it.”</p>

<p>But as it fell lower and lower, the dimness of his moral vision
increased, until at the lowest&mdash;the starvation point&mdash;his eyes
glared and bulged with a ferocious insanity; and when asked
then, “Is it wrong to steal? What is the difference between
<i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>?” he viciously cursed and snarled and snapped
at his questioners, and replied that he did not comprehend their
idiotic jargon, he wanted something to eat.</p>

<p>All which, these philosophers said, demonstrated that Vice,
Crime and Sin (so called) are merely symptoms of Want and
Poverty, and vacuity of the alimentary canal; and they boldly
asserted that a good sound Gospel of Comfort and Plenty,
earnestly preached would do more in five minutes to cleanse the
earth of sin and fill it with righteousness, than all the barkings
of all the salaried barkers, and all the sin suppressing machinery
of clubs and ropes in the world would do in five thousand years.</p>

<p>And when these words came to the ears of the salaried barkers
and the Sin Suppressors they were greatly scandalized, and said
they had never heard such blasphemous and ungospel talk. It
was actually bringing into contempt the sacred machinery of
vice squelching, which had been incorporated by the State, hallowed
by the Church, and had grown through long years and by
the expenditure of great wealth and invention, to the proportions
of a National Institution, and a great Vested Interest. It
was actually insinuating, most wickedly, that there was a short,
simple and direct way of attaining an object, which was a gross
insult to the memory of the heaven-anointed Clubstocks, Elder
Berrys, Blatherskites and other sanctified ones whose genius had
invented the present elaborately involuted, convoluted, conglomerated
and roundabout way of getting at it. But, above
all, it was a direct blow at the livelihood of thousands of good

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>

and moral dogs who were given employment, at good feed, to
operate the machinery, who would, if this new-fangled and
highly irreligious Gospel of Victuals were adopted, be thrown
completely&mdash;yes, completely, brethren&mdash;out of work.</p>

<p>So the Vice Squelchers and the barkers and the eminent fleas
had some of these new gospellers arrested; and they set certain
lewd Dogs of Belial to witness against them that they had blasphemed
Religion, and had plotted a great plot to kill off the
fleas, and inaugurate an awful Society and Civilization of Flealess
Dogs.</p>

<p>Then the judges ordered horns and hoofs and spiked tails and
dragons’ teeth to be fitted upon them, and that they be brought
before the multitude; in whose sight they painted them blacker
than hell, and told the mob that these dogs were dragons and
devils. Whereupon the deceived and enraged multitude did
set up a great cry “Hang them! Hang them! Hang them!”</p>

<p>So they were delivered over to the police dogs, who carried
them away and hanged them.</p>

<p>Thus were <i>they</i> suppressed.</p>

<p>IN process of time it was noised abroad that there existed in
Canisville a crowd of dissolute dogs, who, on the sly and in dark holes
and corners of the town, smeared themselves all over with filth at
night, and danced before other dirty dogs; which other dirty dogs would
reward the dirty dancers with a few bones.</p>

<p>So the dancing dogs were able to live&mdash;which, the dancing dogs
said, was the main thing in life; whereas as for Virtue, there was no
wealth in it; they could get along very nicely without Virtue, but they
must have Victuals. They said they had gone to every market and tried to
exchange their Labor for something to eat, and all the fleas and all the
salaried barkers, and even the missionary dogs, had laughed at them and
uttered some jargon about the Labor Market being

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span>

Glutted, which some dogs, well educated in foreign languages,
had translated unto them to mean, that a very great deal of
Labor would buy only a very little bone with a very little meat
on it, and that all skin and gristle. They had tried to find a
place at the Handle of the fleas’ Blood and Bones Grindery, but
had with difficulty escaped being thrown into the hopper. And
having nothing but Virtue to sell for Victuals they had sold
that; and, strange as it might appear, <i>that</i> fetched a far better
price than honest toil. So, if in the market Labor was held in
such contempt, they did not see that they were bound to hold it
in reverence, and if Society made it easier for poor dogs to be
wicked than virtuous, that was Society’s look-out, not theirs.</p>

<p>So the dirty dogs lived with less discomfort than honest and
virtuous dogs&mdash;that is, than those who <i>passed</i> for honest and
virtuous; for there were multitudes of respected dogs that
passed by daylight as good and proper dogs, that sneaked away
at midnight to the haunts of the filthy dogs, to see them dance.
And there were to be found there, too, very many of the most
highly respected members of the Church of the Fleas, who
took pleasure in the dances of the filthy dogs and paid good
prices for admission thereto, who wouldn’t have had the fact
known for the world.</p>

<p>Now, certain zealous members of the Church of the Fleas, who
were gifted with very long and sharp noses, which they were
eternally poking into business not their own, got to know of the
existence and occupation of the filthy dogs; and they were
greatly scandalized thereby; for these dogs were not only vile
and depraved&mdash;which was bad&mdash;but were escaping the tribute
all dogs were divinely appointed to pay to the support of the
fleas&mdash;which was worse. Therefore, for these two reasons, were
they determined to break up their business and drive them
forth to earn their living by what they called honest toil, that
is, by grinding and fainting at the Handle of the Blood and
Bones Grindery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>These good suckers were awfully “concerned for the spiritual
welfare” of these bad dogs&mdash;that is, they were awfully afraid
they were <i>going to Hell the wrong way</i>; and they were
determined to drive them into the <i>right</i> way. So they called
upon the police dogs to suppress them, to drive them into the
highways and make them “move on.” But they could not
tell the police where they were to “move on” to; and the
police didn’t know, and the comfortable dogs didn’t worry, and
the rich fleas didn’t care, and everybody else said it was none of
his business; and so everything was in a muddle, and nothing
much was done, save that occasionally one of the dirty dogs got
hit on the head.</p>

<p>But in process of time there arose a mighty dog of a prophet
that got exceeding much meat and a great deal of soft comfort
for ministering in one of the churches of the fleas. He was
the Very Reverend Doctor Immaculate Barkworst, and he had
a very much swollen head, with a bump of self-conceit upon it
that stood up like a pinnacle. And he preached thus unto the
sleek fleas:</p>

<p>“Brethren, ye know of this scandal of the filthy dogs in our
midst, how it is corrupting our youth and deteriorating the
quality of the honest dogs that labor; so that Labor&mdash;the noblest,
the most sacred and God-blest occupation that dogs can be
called unto, and which fleas are divinely <i>not</i> called unto&mdash;will
fall into contempt, and the revenues of the fleas&mdash;<i>your</i> revenues,
my dearly beloved masters&mdash;will begin to diminish.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear masters! The strength and safety of our country
lie in keeping our dogs virtuous and industrious, and cultivating
within them the love of the sacred and healthily stimulating
amusements of singing psalms and muttering credos.</p>

<p>“But, my brethren and beloved masters, it is well known that
these scandalous dogs do mock at honest toil and Virtue, and
have irreligiously set up Victuals as the great object of life; and
have, moreover, blasphemously said that the only difference
between us, the salaried barkers, and them, is the difference in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>

Victuals&mdash;thus libellously and contumeliously insinuating that
we do not love Virtue more than Victuals.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear masters, this evil must be driven out at any
cost. We have laws to drive them out. We have every kind
of driving out, moving on, and sin suppressing society to put
them down. Why are they not driven out therefore? Because
the police dogs are vile and corrupt, and “stand in” with
the filthy dogs. I denounce these police dogs, and declare that
<i>we</i> will drive out the filthy dogs, if they won’t.”</p>

<p>And all the sleek and unctuous fleas said the discourse was well
spoken, and that if ever there was a true follower of the meek
and lowly Jesus, this was he. And straightway the zealous
fleas gathered themselves together and organized the “Filthy
Dog Driving Out Society,” and they made the Very Reverend
Doctor Immaculate Barkworst, the President thereof.</p>

<p>And Doctor Immaculate Barkworst again called on the police
dogs in the name of the Law and the Lord and the Driving Out
Society to drive out the filthy dogs. But the police dogs made
excuses and said they were doing the best they could; and if
they could not do more it was for want of Evidence. Whereupon
the Very Reverend Immaculate waxed wroth and said,
“Dogs that ye are; ye unzealous for souls; ye cowardly for
Religion; <i>I</i> will get Evidence.”</p>

<p>So the Immaculate got himself up in slouchy raiment, and
taking with him several soft-headed bow-wows, also got up in
slouchy raiment, proceeded one moonless midnight, by divers
dark and devious ways (which came natural to him), to the
haunt of the filthy dogs, and having knocked at the door, waited
for admission.</p>

<p>Whereupon the Inside Guard of the Haunt peered through
the wicket of the door, and seeing strangers there, demanded of
them, “Who are ye, and what want ye?”</p>

<p>To which demand the Immaculate replied, “We be Jays and
Hayseeds from a far country, and seekers after midnight
pleasures.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“Are ye true and honest seekers?” asked the Inside Guard.</p>

<p>“In the name of honesty and all verity, we are,” answered
the Immaculate.</p>

<p>“But, how shall I know that ye are not spies?” queried the
Inside Guard.</p>

<p>“By our proving to you,” said the Immaculate, “that we are
really and truly filthy dogs, like unto you.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the Inside Guard, “something about your garb
seems to indicate that thou and thy fellows are not what thou
sayest ye are; that ye are not really filthy dogs. Wilt thou
swear to me that ye are what thou sayest ye are?”</p>

<p>“Yea, verily, will I,” replied the Immaculate Barkworst,
“I do solemnly swear, that <i>I</i> am a dirty dog, a very dirty dog;
that in spite of something in my garb, I am a low-down, filthy
reveller from Filthville, and that these, my pals, are as filthy as
I, if not filthier. Behold, also, we have the wherewithal to pay
for seeing your sports.”</p>

<p>But the Inside Guard still suspiciously hesitated, and said,
“Pardon me if I seem discourteous in keeping ye thus long in
the cold; but we are such harassed and hunted dogs; there are
so many Societies seeking our destruction and scatteration, that
we are obliged to be very cautious and careful; and ye may be
spies also seeking to betray us. Now, will ye swear unto us
that if we deal faithfully with you, ye will also deal faithfully
with us?”</p>

<p>And the Immaculate and the other sneaks replied, “We will,”
and they swore.</p>

<p>But the Inside Guard said to the Immaculate, “There yet
seems to be something about thee that betokens that thou hast
been and lived somewhere where the Spirit of Christ is, and
may have somewhat of a taint of that Spirit upon thee, in which
case thou canst in no wise be admitted.”</p>

<p>And the Very Reverend Doctor Immaculate Barkworst was
grieved to be kept so long at the door; and he said, “Before
Heaven, I do solemnly swear that there is no taint of that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span>

objectionable Spirit on me. The Odor thou smellest on me is
the real old honest one that belongs to an Old Frequenter,
which I am. Search me, try me, examine me, smell of me, and
thou shalt find not the slightest trace of that Spirit about me.
And as with me, so it is with these, my pals.”</p>

<p>And the Inside Guard called assistants, and they examined
him with strong magnifying glasses, and turned him over and
inside out, and probed him and smelt of him, and tested him
chemically, and finding no trace of the Spirit of Christ in him,
and that he had told the Truth, they said, “Pass him in; he is
a genuine dirty dog like unto the dirtiest of us, and no spy.”</p>

<p>So the Reverend Immaculate and the other dirty bow-wows
had a high old time; and they saw all the sports and the
dances; and they made themselves at home and hugely enjoyed
the dirty revel; and never once did any of them betray
the slightest sign that they had so much as heard of Jesus.</p>

<p>But afterwards, this dirty dog of a prophet got up in the
Church of the Fleas, and boasted of the things he and his
fellow dirty ones had done; of the dark and devious ways by
which they had gone to the Haunt of the filthy dogs and got
Evidence; of the lies they had told and acted to obtain an
inside sight thereof; of the filth they had smeared themselves
over with to identify themselves with the filthy ones; of the
risk they had run of being caught by the police dogs and “run
in,” as part of the ungodly crew, and of the terrible plight they
would have been in&mdash;had the police dogs caught them&mdash;to explain
to those undiscerning and thick-headed animals that they
were rolling in the filth for a high and lofty moral purpose, and
to the glory of God, and were breaking the law in order to get
it enforced; how they had plighted their troth with them in
order that they might gain their faith in order to violate it, and
betray them to the police dogs, to be worried and mutilated
and made to “move on.”</p>

<p>And all the Church of the Fleas applauded, and said he was a
right lovely dog, who had given the Kingdom of Heaven on

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>

Earth a tremendous shove forward, and brought Society within
measureable distance of the millennium, and had shown beyond
doubt, that the only truly efficacious way of making the Blessed
Gospel Chariot go, was to get the police to push behind; and
asked a special blessing upon him, and made him up a special
basketful of meat, and gave him a holiday to go across the
pond and rest, and lick himself clean.</p>

<p>And at their next session, the “Filthy Dog Driving Out
Society,” resoluted the following resolutions:</p>

<p>“<i>Whereas</i>: Our beloved and right morally lovely servant,
the Very Reverend Doctor Immaculate Barkworst, has, at
immense risk of, and peril to his own virtue, and with a great
sacrifice of Truth and Honesty, explored the Haunt of Vice in
our midst, and turned thereupon a great light, and has caused
the vile inhabitants thereof to be chased out by <i>Law</i>, to “move
on” and die and rot&mdash;as they do most richly deserve&mdash;and has
given us a clean city once more;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_109.jpg" alt="Illustration: CHASED OUT BY LAW." width="200" height="280" />
</div>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>: That we approve his methods; and,<br /><br />
“<i>Resolved</i>: That we hold it to be an irrefragable truth, that the End
always justifies the Means, and that any follower of Jesus may lie in
the cause of Truth; may crawl through the foulest and most stenchful
sewer in the interest of Purity; may break the Law to get Evidence of
its breach by others; may break the most solemnly plighted faith with
sinners in order to trap them into the meshes of the Law; may do all
manner of evil that good may come of it. And finally be it<br /><br />

“<i>Resolved</i>: That the relentless infliction of the penalties of
the Law is the only effective remedy for Sin, and the only sure
way of making sinners love God; and that He who said,
‘Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more,’ was a good-hearted
and very well-meaning person, and all very well for

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>

those antiquated days; but for these enlightened and progressive
days, there is nothing like a well-organized police.”</p>

<p>But when the Very Reverend Doctor Immaculate Barkworst
returned from over the pond, it was found that the fresh air of
Heaven had not quite removed the evil odor of him; for some
of the filth with which he had smeared himself still stuck to
him and made him disagreeable to decent dogs and all save the
fleas of the church and the multitudinous Societies like his
own; and in <i>their</i> nostrils his stenchful odor was a sweet smelling
savor.</p>

<p>And as for the bow-wows that smeared themselves with him,
they never were able to wash themselves quite clean again;
and it was afterwards found that one of them who had sworn
that he was a dirty dog had sworn truly.</p>

<p>EMINENT over all the gangs whose objects were the
“saving” of dogs, was the “Society for the Protection
of the Almighty.” This was the gang of gangs, the
<i>elite</i> of the rest, the real and truly genuine born-blinds,
live-blinds and die-blinds. It had its origin
countless ages before the founding of Canisville, and
had been in all those ages the ever-ready help of
fleas in the bloody exploitation of dogs.</p>

<p>In the beginning did the very acute fleas discover that if dogs
were to be thoroughly and easily bled, they must be taught to
close their eyes and bow down and believe that over them stood
a terrifically awful thing, called Almighty Wrath. And in those

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span>

early times most dogs <i>had</i> closed their eyes and bowed down in
fear of the Wrath that stood over them. And the fleas had
prospered mightily thereby; for they had taken advantage of
the dogs’ prostration to get on their backs in fearful numbers;
and when the dogs had howled and grown restless, they had
hired the salaried barkers of those times to bend over the dogs
and pour into their ears that it was the Will of the Almighty
that they lie quiet under the bleeding of the fleas, the penalty
for disobedience of which Will was to be stricken with lightnings
and everlasting destruction.</p>

<p>But in spite of all the terrors, divers dogs at divers times did
venture with pitter-pattering hearts to slyly steal a look upward,
and seeing nothing real there but fleas, and salaried barkers
bending low and pouring tales of woe into the ears of prostrate
dogs, did nudge their neighbors and tell them to look up and see
for themselves that there was nothing there; which sometimes
the neighbor timidly did, and was disillusionized; but more
often the neighbor dog groaned with additional terror of the
suggestion, and closed his eyes tighter than ever, and grovelled
lower, and prayed that the Almighty would forgive the wickedness
of the temptation and the audacity of the tempter.</p>

<p>However, in time quite a number got to furtively peeping up;
and each dog, seeing others peeping up too, grew bold, and not
only looked up, but stood up, and laughed at his own former
folly and at the long lines of foolish dogs bowed down in fear of&mdash;&mdash;Nothing.</p>

<p>Whereupon the fleas and the barkers were alarmed and counselled
together as to what was best to be done; for they foresaw
that if all the dogs got to looking up they would see that the
Almighty Vengeance was a Fiction, and might also proceed to
the impious length of casting the fleas off their backs.</p>

<p>So they agreed that something strong must be done, and done
quickly, or the Almighty might be overthrown and perish.
Some of the fleas counselled that the barkers increase their
diligence in assuring the prostrate dogs of the reality of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span>

Wrath, and use more Imagination in the recital of his terrors.
And certain barkers of naturally gloomy minds, who loved to
wander at midnight amongst the skulls and bones of dead dogs,
and to meditate until their imaginations had grown lurid, voluntarily
set themselves apart to invent more horrible attributes
and diabolical features to be affixed to the Almighty.</p>

<p>But some of the barkers objected that this would involve
much labor&mdash;which, as salaried barkers, they were on principle
opposed to, ease and good feed being the main object of their
lives&mdash;and they proposed to protect the Almighty by a more
easy (to them) and more reliable method. They said that the
horrible inventions would certainly be very good for the dogs
which were still prostrate, and there were, no doubt, some good,
conscientious barkers to whose gloomy minds the horrible inventions
would be a labor of love; but they were sure the horrible
inventions would be too late for the dogs which had already
looked up and got to laughing. Why not turn the protection
of the Almighty over to the police dogs? Themselves would
make Blue Thunderbolts, and set the police dogs to launch
them at every dog discovered holding his head up and laughing.
Thus the Almighty would be protected, and the heavy labor of
doing it would devolve on other dogs.</p>

<p>This proposition was received with great favor, and was
deemed a worthy supplement to the Horrible Inventions.</p>

<p>And it was so, that the most gloomy-minded barkers with the
lurid imaginations were set apart to invent the horrible attributes
to attach to the already too horrible Fiction with which they
terrified the prostrate dogs. These lurid-minded barkers set to
with gusto and zest, and very soon had revised and re-created
him into the most bloodily cruel, pitiless and unnatural monster
of ferocity and hate towards those who did not want to bow
down to him, that the theology-debauched canine mind had
ever conceived. This they called, generically, the Character of
God. They also formulated all the particulars of the manifestation
of his imaginary cruel hate, which consisted of the most

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span>

blood-freezing terrors, damnations and eternal pains, which
they called by the generic name of Hell.</p>

<p>All these Horrible Inventions the other salaried barkers said
were most glorious, blessed and eternal <i>truths</i>, which had the
sanction of all true believers, and they were to be poured diligently
into the ears of all prostrate dogs.</p>

<p>And they did pour these blessed truths into their ears, with
great success; for many of the dogs at the recital thereof went
into fits; many went insane, and most of the rest terrifiedly
burrowed deeply in the earth in their desire to prostrate themselves
still lower.</p>

<p>But, as had been prophesied, the up-looking dogs only laughed
the more at the great Almighty Fiction, and the poor fools who
bowed down to it; and they even barked out blasphemous words
of contempt of the new woes and the lurid-minded inventors
thereof.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_114.jpg" alt="Illustration: EXCOMMUNICATE!" width="400" height="268" />
</div>

<p>Whereupon the lurid-minded barkers, at the request of the fleas, did
call in more effectual help for the protection of the Almighty; for
they called in the police dogs, and gave them the Blue Thunderbolts
which the other barkers had invented, and ordered them to launch them
at the contumelious dogs. Which the police dogs did. And many of those
contumelious dogs got it heavily in the neck, and fell over dead or sore
wounded; which caused the rest of them to laugh on the other side of
their mouths; for they found that although the Almighty Vengeance might
be a fiction, the Blue Thunderbolts were terrible facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>And the Blue Thunderbolt launchers got to like the sport of
keeling over contumelious dogs; for it gratified their brutal
instincts which would otherwise have been wasted in torturing
and killing other creatures, and at the same time gave them a
great reputation for piety, and zeal for God; all which was very
gratifying; <i>for they found it exceedingly cheap and easy to be
pious along the line of their strongest brutal impulses</i>. And
the salaried barkers liked it too; for it released them from the
hard labor of persuading the dogs to bow down to the profitable
Almighty Fiction.</p>

<p>But the lust of keeling over contumelious dogs grew so
strong that it outran the supply of dogs to be keeled over; and
it often happened that the dogs, being all prostrate and in fear,
the police dogs, armed with Blue Thunderbolts, found no one
to launch them against; which they looked upon as a most
grievous grievance; and they thereupon reproached the barkers
with giving them too little to do. So the gloomy barkers, thinking
that a little extra terror might be a little extra protection to
the Almighty, besides keeping the police dogs in a cheerful
frame of mind, went about amongst the prostrate dogs, and
arbitrarily picked out many whom they charged with <i>thinking</i>
blasphemy and ridicule of the Almighty Fiction, and by force
stood them up for the launchers of Blue Thunderbolts to knock
over.</p>

<p>But as time went on there came from over the pond many new
dogs to Canisville who did not know anything about the Almighty
Fiction or Blue Thunderbolts, and they circulated amongst the
prostrate dogs and hustled and jostled them and laughed at
them, so that the former bold dogs, feeling encouraged, got up
and laughed too; and many of the others got ashamed of their
prostration, and took a little heart, and ventured to look up, and
little by little, leg by leg, they got up and walked, and laughed
surprisedly at seeing nothing to fear but Blue Thunderbolts; and
the lazy barkers found it too much trouble to get them to lie
down again; and the police dogs, being brutal and cowardly,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>

slunk away ashamed and dropped their Blue Thunderbolts in
dark holes and swamps where they rotted and rusted.</p>

<p>And that was how the great Almighty Fiction lost his almighty
grip on the dogs and went under a cloud.</p>

<p>THE barkers were all true and immovable believers in
the musty and mouldy old doctrine that whatsoever
was in the beginning ought to be now and forever,
world without end, amen. So they still held
themselves together as the Society for the Protection
of the Almighty, as they had found by past sad
experience that he could not be trusted to take care of himself.</p>

<p>And, oh! It was a solemn and sad society, that did nothing
but weep and mourn for the “Good Old Days” of the past,
when dogs were all kept with their noses heavenward (downward)
by the wholesome administration of Blue Thunderbolts.
And they formed themselves into a solemn Order, which they
called the “Sacred Order of Ancient Timers and Holy Retrogressionists.”
And they had a sacred ritual of mourning and a
service of weeping, and ordinary, extraordinary and special
days of moaning, lamentation and bewailment, and prayer for
the resurrection of the dead past.</p>

<p>They met weekly in a damp and dead smelling catacomb, at
the solemn hour of midnight, and by the darkling light of
smoky torches, stuck in the eyeholes of skulls. In the center
of the meeting place was a huge crape-covered, black lachrymatory
or weeping pot, around which they gathered to moan, and
into which they shed their tears.</p>

<p>To the north of the lachrymatory was stationed the Grand
Lugubrious Lachrymator, supported by the Worthy Right

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span>

Hand and the Worthy Left Hand Weepers; to the south was
the Vice Grand Lugubrious Lachrymator, supported by the
Worthy Eyerag Wringer, and his assistant, the Assistant
Worthy Eyerag Wringer. To the east was the Past and Bygone
Lugubrious Lachrymator, and opposite him was the
Worthy Grand Exalted Moaner, who read the prayers.</p>

<p>And at the tap of a funeral bell, the Grand Lugubrious Lachrymator
read from the Solemn Ritual these words:</p>

<p>“Oh mourning brethren of the Eternal Tear Drop: It hath
been appointed unto us to bewail the good old days of Prostrate
Piety and Blue Thunderbolts; when the glory of Simple Faith
was as the sun in mid-heaven; when Reason&mdash;wicked Faith-upsetting
Reason&mdash;was in chains; when our ever glorious
Almighty Vengeance and beloved Hell reigned supreme, and
blaspheming questioners were stricken dead; when dogs everywhere
piously and in the fear of God, gave up their blood to
their lawful and divinely appointed suckers, the fleas.</p>

<p>“These times are temporarily past; but our holy traditions,
and the promises made by our Almighty Vengeance&mdash;who for
some great, unfathomably wise and mysterious purpose, has
suffered himself to be cast into the shade for a time&mdash;tell us
that the ancient glory shall be re-established, the temporarily
overthrown throne of our darksome God shall be again set up,
and to him again shall the nose of every dog be held down in
the dirt; the blasphemers and up-looking dogs shall perish out
of the land, the Blue Thunderbolts shall be refurbished and
shine with a latter-day glory, that shall be to the former glory
as the midday sun is to the midnight star. How saith the Vice
Grand Lugubrious Lachrymator?”</p>

<p>And the Vice Grand Lugubrious Lachrymator from <i>his</i> book
of the Ritual read:</p>

<p>“Yea, Verily; and let all Ancient Timers and Holy Retrogressionists
of the pure and genuine musty and mouldy odor,
say Amen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>At which all the assembly lifted up their noses and groaned
“Amen.”</p>

<p>Then said the Grand Lugubrious Lachrymator: “The
Worthy Grand Exalted Moaner will now put up the Solemn
Wail. Let all bow the head.”</p>

<p>And all the Order bowed their heads while the Worthy
Grand Exalted Moaner, from <i>his</i> book of the Ritual, recited:</p>

<p>“Oh, Almighty Vengeance, Fiction Eternal: Why art thou
hidden from us? Why have we lost thee? Why hast thou suffered
the clouds of unbelief to encompass thee? Why hast
thou suffered the extinguisher of raillery to snuff thee out, so
to speak? Oh, grief be unto us that adversity hath overtaken
thee, and the blasphemer and the pesky sinful dog are on top!
Oh, we did prosper by thee. Thou wast our daily bread. We
had invested in thee. When thou wast the All-Powerful Terror,
then were we in power; then were we held in awe and reverence,
and many basketfuls of meat and a lazy life were ours.
But, oh, Ichabod, the glory is departed and our house is left
unto us desolate. Mirth and gladness are fled away from us;
our meat is diminished, and our comfortable lazy life is turned
into a daily hustle, and none but fools and simpletons esteem
us reverend.</p>

<p>“Oh glorious Past! Oh departed Power, Greatness and
Glory, come again from the dead to us. Oh, time of blessed
dog ignorance, come, oh, come back again. Oh, shadow on the
dial of time, turn back; oh, wheel of progress, revolve the
hindward way. Oh, Almighty Fiction, if thou canst, re-establish
thyself; set up thy discarded Hell again, and cause it to be
respected. Blight and blast Thought, Reason, Progress and
all other modern and wicked things, and cause thyself and us
once more to prosper. Meanwhile we wait and weep and wail,
and wail and weep and wait for thee, Amen.”</p>

<p>The Solemn Wail having been recited, all the Order, as the
last act of the service, gathered around the lachrymatory, and
shed therein all the tears of their sorrow, and when it was full

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span>

to overflowing, they poured it out on the altar as a libation to
their horrible God.</p>

<p>After which sad rite the service was adjourned, and the
celebrants, in silence, filed home one by one.</p>

<p>IN the latter days of the sad existence of the Society for the
Protection of the Almighty, there arose most strangely from nowhere, a
huge, heavy-footed dog, that ran about scattering dismay and confusion
amongst the salaried barkers, by encouraging the dogs to speak
disrespectfully of the various societies in general, and of the Society
for the Protection of the Almighty in particular.</p>

<p>A very independent and fearless dog was he. He was
endowed with a voice of thunder and an eye of lightning, and
he had a set of great sharp teeth that seemed to have been made

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 122]</span>

especially and particularly to tear and worry the salaried barkers,
and the pious dog thumpers and clubbers.</p>

<p>Wherever they gathered together, there he appeared in the
midst of them to spoil their counsels, to frustrate their plans,
and drive them crazy. Never did they meet save to devise some
new way to harass the forlorn and hungry dogs, in the name
of God and to the enrichment of the fleas, and never did they
meet but they had to meet the lightning of his eye, the thunder
of his voice, and the cutting snap of his gleaming teeth; which,
after braving and enduring a few times, they learned to respect
by tucking their tails snugly away between their legs and scattering
with howls of pain and rage, to the accompaniment of
the laughter of the poor dogs which gratefully recognized in
him a friend.</p>

<p>All the pious dog thumpers, the virtue compellers, the morality
cobblers hated him because he boldly told them that the
Tree of Virtue could only grow up out of the ground of Good
Victuals and healthy bodies, which they said was a wicked and
damnable heresy and subversive of the good old Gospel of the
Club; and all the salaried barkers hated him because he laughed
at their Almighty Fiction, and called it the ugly creation of their
own diseased brains.</p>

<p>So, not being able to face him in a stand-up fight, they went
about seeking his destruction in sly and roundabout ways.</p>

<p>First, they tried their most powerful weapon&mdash;a nickname.
His name was Robertus Robustus, for he was of great strength.
Therefore they went about amongst the poor dogs calling him
“Bob,” for it was a sacred religious principle with all salaried
barkers to call everyone that was obnoxious to them, by a contemptuous
nickname. They had discovered through long
experience that heresies amongst dogs were more easily prevented
than cured; that it was more efficacious to bring any one
into contempt with them, than to let them see him, hear him
and judge of him for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>So they called him “Bob,” and sneered over his name whenever
they spoke of him; and they tried to get the dogs to have a
horror of him by describing him as a beast with horns, hoofs
and a long spiked tail; and bore other false witness against him;
“for,” said they, “the case is urgent; the very existence of our
God is imperilled, and a little false witness to save him He will
surely pardon, for all is fair in love and theological war.”</p>

<p>But what caused these salaried barkers to hate him so
intensely was the fact that “Bob” was a very good and noble
dog, and showed more real kindness of heart and love for the
down-trodden and afflicted dogs than they. They reasoned
amongst themselves, and boldly told the dogs that all God-despisers,
all belittlers of the Almighty Fiction, always had been
bad, must necessarily be bad, and therefore “Bob” the God
despiser and ridiculer, must necessarily be bad too; that all contempt
of the ever blessed Almighty Vengeance, and his ever
glorious Hell and the benign eternal tortures, did and <i>must</i>
proceed from a corrupt and wicked heart; that none but believers
in the Unutterable Horror, were or <i>could</i> be good; therefore,
“Bob’s” heart must be rotten and his life wicked. And when a
dog objected that the <i>fact</i> that “Bob’s” life being good did not
agree with and justify their theory, they said that was all the
worse for the fact.</p>

<p>So they proclaimed abroad that “Bob’s” goodness was an
irregular, unsanctified and wicked goodness, more wicked than
immorality; a cloak “put on” to hide the devilishness of his
purpose, which was to steal their God and leave the dogs Godless;
which the salaried barkers all and unanimously declared
was a great step to the next greatest misfortune&mdash;to leave the
dogs flealess.</p>

<p>But “Bob” Robertus Robustus cared not. He went on showing
himself and laughing at the Almighty Monstrosity, and
pleading with the remaining prostrate dogs to lift up their
heads, and generally making the many societies look silly.</p>

<p>So the salaried barkers, perceiving that this big dog had
grown very dangerous, and that dogs everywhere were growing

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>

irreverent, and that instead of receiving with meekness and
with the wide open mouth of Simple Faith, the large chunks of
ancient and mouldy dogmas of Orthodox Religion, with which
the barkers daily fed them, were falling into the wicked habit
of shutting the mouth of Simple Faith, and opening the eye of
Reason, and smelling, with an inquiring smeller, of the ancient
and mouldy dogmas, and poking the nose of irreverence into
the “why” and “wherefore” of all the sacred humbugs,
resolved to call a conference to devise ways and means to stay
the ravages this dangerous dog was working.</p>

<p>All the little and lesser salaried barkers came to the conference
with fear and trembling, for their little souls were weighed
down with the conviction that if something were not done soon
to this irreverent dog, it was all up with them; but when they
saw that the Reverend Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite was there,
they took heart of hope, for they all knew him to be a most valiant
defender of Simple Faith and enemy of Reason.</p>

<p>One of them therefore arose and said: “Brethren and fellow
barkers; we to whom has been committed the care of the ever
holy dogmas, upon which, up to the present, we have been
enabled to preserve the blessed hoary mould and the ancient
musty smell, are gathered here to-day by a common sense of a
common peril. Ye know that there hath arisen amongst the
dogs a fierce and wicked dog of large dimensions and great
strength, who is teaching them to laugh at sacred things and
bring <i>us</i> into contempt. Now, it follows that if we are brought
into contempt, not only will our living be gone (which is the
thing of greatest moment), but the divinely ordained relations
between the dogs and our patrons and masters, the fleas, will be
disrupted, and go to the dogs; and we, the divinely appointed
guardians of those sacred relations, shall draw upon our heads
the wrath of the Monstrous Fleas, who will regard us as unfaithful
stewards of their interests.</p>

<p>“In this perilous hour, then, we need some one who will point
a way out of our trouble. I am happy to say I see with us our

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</span>

valiant friend, the Reverend Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite.”
(Immense and prolonged barking by the whole assembly.) “I
need not say he is our champion. Ye all intuitively perceive
that there is none so fit as he to grapple with this newly arisen
terror of a dog.</p>

<p>“I propose, therefore, that he be appointed our standard bearer,
our sword wielder, our lightning discharger, our thunderer
against our enemy.” (Immense and prolonged acclaim.) “Is he
not most fit, I say, to be our champion? Is he not most valorous
of mouth? Pours there not therefrom the most undammed
torrent of eloquence that ever tumbled from the lips of mortal
barker? Is he not the tried and proven champion Reason
destroyer? Yea, verily, brethren. How many times has my
soul been exalted with pride, as I have seen him in battle with
Reason, belt him over the head, give it him in the neck, upper
and under cut him, roast him in the ribs, cross buttock him,
overthrow him, kick him, kill him.” (Great barking.) “Yea,
verily, brethren, there never was, in all this world, a barker so
contrary to Reason, so deadly a foe to it as he. He is worthy
to be our leader.” (Loud and prolonged acclaim, and cries of,
“He is; he is; he is;” and calls of “Blatherskite, <i>Blatherskite</i>,
<span class="smcap">Blatherskite</span>.”)</p>

<p>Whereupon the great Reverend Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite
arose and opened his mouth and spake:</p>

<p>“Brethren of the Most Holy Order of Divine Barkers: I feel
proud of the high honor ye have conferred upon me in calling
me to be your champion against this Goliath, who so impudently
cometh forth to defy the armies of the living Almighty. Who
is this dog that imagineth, with his great spear of Reason, to
smite and slay our ancient Simple Faith? With my little sling
and stone will I smite him, and he shall be no more. My
brother, who proposed me to be your leader, was right in his
generous eulogy of me; I do despise and hate Reason with all
my soul. I hate it as a deadly snake and trample it under foot
every time I get the chance&mdash;which is every time I speak. This

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>

wielder of the spear of Reason, this Bob, this God-stealer, is an
infidel and a blasphemer, and will go straight down to Hell, like
that friend of his, that dirty dog, that Tom who wrote the ‘Age
of Reason,’ and was tormented of our God for it. Oh, my
brethren, he suffered untold agonies in his conscience, and
served him right, too. At least we barkers have always said he
did, because he ought to have suffered if he didn’t. Some there
are who say we lie when we say he suffered, but I don’t believe
that <i>our</i> God would allow any one to preach Reason without
making it all-fired hot for him; at least I know if <i>I</i> had been
God, <i>I</i> would have made his soul shriek with pain; <i>I</i> would
have tormented him, for there is nothing more fatal to <i>our</i> religion
and <i>our</i> interests than Reason. Then down with Reason,
I say, for it is the whole Devil, and every truly sanctified barker’s
eternal enemy.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_126.jpg" alt="Illustration: WITH MY LITTLE SLING
AND STONE WILL I SMITE HIM." width="200" height="252" />
</div>

<p>“As for this other Reasoner, this Bob, surely we can kill him, just
as we killed his predecessor, Tom. Never call him by his respectable
name of Robert; none but barkers and true believers are entitled
to be called by their respectable names. That’s how we overthrew
Thomas&mdash;by contemptuously calling him Tom. We got the world to
deride him; that was far more easy than to refute his book. Call him
‘Bob,’ then; and brethren, in a cause so momentous and holy as this, ye
may even lie about him; for the world will always believe anything evil
about a dog with a bad name; but if by any miracle of grace he should
ever be converted, <i>then</i> ye shall call him Robert, and esteem him
respectable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_127.jpg" alt="Illustration: BOB, THE GOD-STEALER." width="275" height="249" />
</div>

<p>“This Bob is an awful public danger; if he be allowed to run around
loose he will steal our God, he will overthrow the Almighty; he will
deprive the dogs of the inestimable blessing of having something to
worship. Already hath he somewhat loosened his eternal foundations, and
shaken his immovable fixtures, and on several occasions, had it not been
for us rushing to his rescue, our Almighty must have been overthrown.</p>

<p>“Now, brethren, this constant strain upon our minds, this perpetual
anxiety to ward off this beast’s constant attacks upon
our omnipotent God, is wearing us to skin and bone. Something
ought to be done to restrain him. Have we not laws to
imprison such as he? Yea, verily, have we. Have we not
laws against blasphemy? Yea, we have. Then why is this dog
allowed to go about putting our God in peril? Why is he
allowed to go about sapping and mining under his feet with
intent to make him fall? He has been caught many times boring
holes in his anatomy and letting in the daylight; he has
been convicted many times of exposing the mystery of his
flaming eyes and his smoking mouth and nostrils, yet nothing
has been done to him. Where are the police? Where are the
good old Blue Thunderbolts? Alas! they rust and rot in the
swampy places, where our cowardly police dogs dropped them
when Unbelief reared its ugly head in our midst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“Oh brethren, what we need is a great revival of the good old-fashioned
Blue Laws and the Blue Thunderbolts. We need the
re-erection of the good old safeguards wherewith our fathers
surrounded our Almighty God, and preserved him, which the
degenerate dogs of this day have allowed to fall into innocuous
desuetude. Oh! we need the revival of the good old methods,
by which Reason and Unbelief were held down by the strong
hand of the Law, and the eternal, almighty and all-convincing
truths of our only genuine and original Gospel were given a show.</p>

<p>“No wonder that True Religion and Simple Faith prospered
and prevailed in those days; for the authorities were all holy
and did their duty&mdash;the police were effective. And no wonder
that Reason and Unbelief stalk haughtily abroad to-day and
our omnipotent Almighty is despised, rejected and shoved to
the rear; for our laws are obsolete, and our authorities careless
and indifferent about helping him.</p>

<p>“Let us then, pray for a great outpouring of holy zeal upon
the police, that they may be inspired to dig up the good old
Thunderbolts and polish them for use again. Is not this Bob dog
a public nuisance? Is he not endeavoring to make all dogs godless,
and by so doing endeavoring to overthrow the country, even
as his friend the Tom dog tried to do in his day, and perhaps
would have done had not God caused him to die an infidel’s
death?</p>

<p>“His suppression, then, ought to be the public concern, and I
call on our police, our rulers, and all fleas big and little that
have the love of God and Country in their hearts to put him
down, imprison him, and forever shut his mouth.”</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this magnificent burst of oratory all the
assembled barkers burst into loud and prolonged approbation,
and some one moved, and another seconded, and another supported,
and the assembly unanimously carried a Resolution; that</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Our good old Almighty and fearful God and his
blessed eternal Hell are menaced by a certain blasphemous dog,
of the name of Bob, with utter destruction and overthrow, and<br />
<br />
“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The said destruction and overthrow of the said
Almighty would lead straight and swift to utter godlessness
amongst dogs, and to the setting up of Thought and Reason in<br />
his place, and<br />
<br />
“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, In the setting up of said Thought and Reason,
all dogs everywhere would be led to shake off all allegiance
they owe to the divinely appointed fleas, and with them us and
all our vested worldly interests,<br />
<br />
“<i>Resolved</i>, That we call upon Pup McPoodle, his counsellors,
the police, and all who have the safety of the country and the
welfare of dogs at heart to arise at once in their might and rescue
our terribly beleaguered and imperilled God, by smiting this Bob
and all his following with a great smiting greatly, and if necessary
killing them all, and hand over their souls to us for damnation,
which we undertake to do with all solemnity, neatness and
despatch.”</p>

<p>And this resolution was signed by all the Society for the Protection
of the Almighty, and all the other many Anti-Evil Societies,
and all the eminent and Monstrous Fleas, and was carried
by Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite and other choice-souled barkers
to the authorities. And the authorities said it was a very
fine resolution, and did great credit to the holy zeal and patriotism
of all concerned; and nothing would give them greater
pleasure than to make the poor dogs more miserable if it were
possible; but just now there seemed to be no feasible way of
doing it, and they were afraid that their Almighty would have
to wag along as best he could, for the present. Anyhow, they
would see about it&mdash;they would see about it.</p>

<p>NOW it was at this evil time, when the meagre, weak and bloodless
misery of the dogs had reached its depth, and the burden upon them of
the unasked-for means for their salvation was heaviest; and the fleas
had reached the limit of their biggest and tightest expansibility, that
a vague terror took possession of the fleas. This was occasioned by the
strange behavior of the dogs at various times.</p>

<p>Sometimes a dog, right in the midst of his very insanest
scratching for food, would flop suddenly down in the gutter
and look up to heaven, and sigh and scratch his head as though
he had a dark problem on his mind, the solution of which might
be found up there. After a spell of this sort of contemplation
the dog would as suddenly resume his insanity, apparently having
concluded that his looking up there was in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>Then it was noticed that several insane dogs, when they met,
would stop and all together look up to heaven, and sigh and then
look into each other’s eyes, as though seeking therein for light
on some dark conundrum; when, after a few moments of such
contemplation, they would all simultaneously let off a bark of
disappointment, resume their insanity and scatter.</p>

<p>On brilliant moonlight nights, some of the dogs that had
looked up to heaven in the daytime and seen nothing, would
stare up at the moon for a long time and wag their tails and
heads with apparent satisfaction, and bark vociferously; but no
one gave heed to them, as they were said to be lunatics.</p>

<p>Others meandered down to the edge of the pond, and after
gazing in a distraught and far-away manner for a time, would
shake their heads, and, suddenly turning tail, would scamper
off and fall to their scratching more madly than ever.</p>

<p>Sometimes hundreds of them would gather in the open
places and look, some towards the East, some towards the
West, some towards the North, and some towards the South,
and some towards the zenith, and each set would bark.</p>

<p>And it was told the eminent fleas, and the large fleas, and the
Monstrous Fleas, how many of the dogs were behaving. And
the fleas were much concerned, and called all the wise fleas that
could be found, and diligently inquired of them what time this
erratic behavior had broken out, and what it might mean?</p>

<p>And the wise fleas answered they didn’t know unless it was
that some queer and unusual disease had broken out amongst
them, and they were having spells of sanity, and might during
those spells, be thinking and pondering and meditating, in
which case it behooved the fleas to watch them closely and
take steps to apply some remedy.</p>

<p>Some of the fleas said that was sound advice and ought to be
taken at once, as thinking was the very worst disease a dog
could have. Experience had shown that this disease was a
most insidious one, whose first symptoms were very insignificant
and unimportant, but in time developed into a most contagious,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span>

infectious and deadly plague, and they would advise
that a Board of Health be organized at once, and a number of
inspectors be appointed to make domiciliary visits amongst the
dogs to ascertain and report on their mental condition. Thus, a
possible epidemic of thinking might be checked in its incipiency,
and a possibly great calamity avoided.</p>

<p>But most of the fleas said they didn’t think there was any
cause for alarm&mdash;at least just now; for if the dogs had really
caught the thinking infection, it was so slightly that it would
amount to nothing; but if the case should really grow serious,
they had great confidence that the police dogs were so good and
faithful (being well fed), that any very serious case would be
promptly quarantined; and if extreme measures should be
called for, the dog so afflicted could be killed; which was, in
the opinion of all eminent fleas, an infallible cure in the case of
<i>that</i> dog, and an infallible preventive of the disease in any other.</p>

<p>So the fleas went on making themselves comfortable and did
not form any Board of Health.</p>

<p>The dogs, however, got no better, and still went about staring
at vacancy.</p>

<p>One day a dog that had flopped down in the gutter to sigh
and scratch his head, and look up to heaven, seeing another
dog looking up into heaven said unto him: “Why gazest thou
so earnestly up into heaven?”</p>

<p>And the other dog said: “And why gazest <i>thou</i> so earnestly
up into heaven?”</p>

<p>And the first dog replied: “Because I am convinced that it
comes from above.”</p>

<p>And the second dog, encouraged, said: “That also is my conviction.
I am sure we work hard enough to make a living, yet
the harder we work the harder it is to make a living.”</p>

<p>“It is a mystery,” said the first dog.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed,” replied the second dog, “a great and deep
mystery. It must be that Heaven is angry with us for our sins,
and that this our everlasting hunger and defeat of the object of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span>

all our life-long scratching for food is Heaven’s chastisement,
which, as the good missionaries and Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite
have so often told us, though for the present it seemeth
grievous, will at last work out for us a far more exceeding
plenty in the grubful Canaan up there.”</p>

<p>Which far-away heavenly prospect made them both sigh tremendously,
and bring their gaze back again to earth, where
they saw, not many yards away, another dog looking up into
heaven. He gazed thitherward for a long time, and sadly sighing,
was about to resume his normal insanity and rush off,
when he gave a terrible yelp, which was caused by an unusually
venomous nip, by an unusually large and powerful flea, right
in the region of the root of his tail. Turning to pay attention
to the trouble there, he saw a lot of fleas skipping and scampering
about, and having a most hilarious time, and some, he
imagined, were laughing at him.</p>

<p>Why he paid especial regard to such a common phenomenon,
he did not know and could not have told. Probably it was
because he was afflicted with a more than usually bad spell of
sanity and mental lucidity, and had what the other dogs called
a “Jag” on, during the continuance of which he had visions of
things as they really were. Whatever the reason, he stared at
them even more fixedly and concentratedly than ever he had
gazed up into heaven. His eyes grew big and bulged, and the
longer he stared the bigger they grew and the more they bulged.
Then slowly there came into them a strange and unaccustomed
light, as of a consciousness that was returning after a prolonged
absence from home. After a time he winked an eye and then
rubbed both very hard with his paws, and ejaculated: “Blamed
if I don’t think I have been looking in the wrong direction. I
don’t think it comes from above, after all. I do believe it’s
fleas.” And he wagged his head sapiently and looked at the
fleas again, and wagged his head once more, which having done
several times, as though to confirm himself in the surety that he

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span>

had really made a great discovery, he trotted away; and the
other two observing dogs followed him.</p>

<p>He trotted away to where some of the other dogs were gazing
steadfastly up into heaven, and poking some of them in the ribs
he cried, “Fleas, fleas;” then leaving them to growl and curse
his disturbance of their meditations, he trotted down to a group
that were gazing far away over the pond, and poking some of
their ribs, he cried, “Fleas, ye blind! Fleas;” and leaving
them to snarl and curse, he betook himself to the public places
where sundry groups were gazing and barking towards the East
and towards the West, and towards the North and towards the
South, and cried aloud, “Fleas, ye fools! Fleas.” But most of
the dogs, whose gazing was thus rudely disturbed, took umbrage
thereat, and chased him, and demanded to know why he had
thus violently and ill-behavedly broken in upon their meditations?</p>

<p>“Because,” said he, “I want you to look in the right direction;
I have just found out what is amiss with us all&mdash;it is <i>fleas</i>;
<span class="smcap">Fleas</span>, and <i>nothing but fleas</i>.”</p>

<p>But the heavenward gazers said: “Not so; our troubles come
from above; it is Heaven that hath mysteriously, but, no doubt,
in infinite wisdom, afflicted us, as say the salaried barkers.”</p>

<p>“Heaven!” cried another crowd, “Nonsense; they do not;
any fool can see they come from the East.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and none <i>but</i> fools can see they come from the East or
from Heaven; all wise dogs know they come from the West,
from the land of the almond-eyed, long-tailed Yellow Dog,”
cried the Westward gazers, who themselves had come from the
East.</p>

<p>“A fine lot of wise dogs ye are!” cried the Southward gazers,
“since it’s as plain as daylight that our hunger and poverty are
entirely from the South, in the shape of those inferior kinky-haired
Black Dogs that are used to hunger and can bear it better
than we.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! Ha! He! He! He!” laughed the Northward
gazers. “Come off, do. That is the silliest explanation yet.
Anyone with the smallest and feeblest faculty of observation
can see that the North is the only and all sufficient source of all
our afflictions.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Fools and idiots that ye are!” yelled the pondward
gazers. “Ye are all wrong; any one can see that our troubles
are all due to the coming of those dirty dogs from over the pond,
from Hungryland, Dirtland and Choleraland.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried a little crowd that had arrived but a short time
from thence, “It’s a shame to allow so many in, filling up the
country and snatching our bones. There ought to be a law
passed.”</p>

</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>“And if it had not been for your coming,” screamingly replied
a crowd that had arrived a long time before, “we would
not be starving now. The gates ought to have been shut long
ago.”</p>

<p>“Aye, Aye,” sneered a lot of the native born dogs, “the day
after <i>you</i> got safe in, of course. For our part, we think it a
wicked outrage on us that foreigners were allowed here at all,
taking the bread out of the mouths of the rightful owners of
the country. There ought to have been a law passed at first to
keep out foreigners.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“And where would your fathers have been then?” sneered
back the foreigners.</p>

<p>And the contention waxed hot; each angrily vociferating that
all the others were fools, idiots and liars, and they put out their
tongues at one another, and snarled and growled; and at last
they got into an awful fight; from which many of them emerged
with torn ears and noses, broken legs, loosened teeth and amputated
tails.</p>

<p>But as for the unfortunate dog that said “Fleas,” he was badly
battered, for in the general fight every one of the combatants
struck at <i>him</i>. But he got away at last and hid himself.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there were some of the far-away gazers that
after the fight could not help thinking over the suggestive words
he had let fall; and they thought that <i>possibly</i> their afflictions
did come wholly and solely from their fleas.</p>

<p>The consequence was that these dogs took to regarding the
fleas continually and very intently; and other dogs, wondering
what they were looking at so much, began also to look at the
fleas.</p>

<p>AND it was told the fleas that a dog had arisen,
that had said: “Fleas, ye fools, fleas,” and had
drawn several other dogs after him, whom he
had taught to say likewise.</p>

<p>And the eminent fleas, and the big fleas, and
the Monstrous Fleas, gathered themselves together,
and sent a quick flea unto certain wise
fleas saying, “Haste ye, and come quickly to our aid, for the
dread pestilence hath broken out; tarry not in all the way, for
the matter is urgent.”</p>

<p>And the wise fleas came on the hop and the skip and the
jump, and said: “We told you so; we did advise you not to
despise the day of small symptoms; but ye heeded not our advice.
Therein ye did err; for it is well known that we know a
thing or two. We did advise you that that intent gazing of
the dogs did betoken the outbreak of an epidemic of thinking
amongst them, which, had it been grappled with then, would
have been easy to stamp out; but now we fear the disease has
made dangerous progress. This thinking of theirs has reached
the stage of audible expression, which is the stage of most rapid
contagion and infection.”</p>

<p>“True, true,” said a Monstrous Flea&mdash;Andronicus Carnivorous&mdash;pale
with affright; “We are credibly informed that
some of these dogs have even lifted up their voices in the public

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span>

places, and boldly told the other dogs that if they had no fleas
they need never be hungry; to which some of the listening
dogs, it is reported, replied, ‘Down with the fleas.’ And we
have been informed&mdash;but for the truth of it we cannot vouch&mdash;that
quite a number of those suffering from this truly terrible
thinking disease, have formed what they call the ‘Flealess
Dog Club,’ which slyly meets at midnight, and dances with
delirious joy over the prophesied coming of a most dreadful
time when all dogs will be free from all fleas of every sort
and size.”</p>

<p>And all the assembled fleas cried out in chorus, “Alas, what
shall we do?”</p>

<p>But the wise fleas said, “Courage, brethren; all is not lost;
there is a margin of safety left, which, if utilized properly, will,
with God’s blessing, restore these poor dogs to their usual state
of insanity, and avert the danger of our extinction. Ye ought,
of course, to have grappled with this malady in its incipiency;
nevertheless, with an extra effort, lost time may be made up,
and the disease stamped out. A Board of Public Safety must
be formed at once.”</p>

<p>“Had we not better pass a law,” said a Monstrous Flea&mdash;Pharaoh
Phrique&mdash;“making it a capital offence for a dog to
think, and have all the guilty ones executed with great tortures?
There’s nothing like striking terror into the hearts of the dogs,
if you want to keep them good and healthy.”</p>

<p>“Aye! Aye!” chorused all the others fiercely, “that’s the
talk.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Brother Phrique,” replied a wise flea, “for dissenting
from so eminent a dog killer as thyself; but all wise
fleas have found that the only true and efficacious way is, not
to kill the thinkers, but to discourage the breed; to let the
thinkers die off naturally, and replace them with a breed of non-thinkers.
To this end their brains must be watched, and where-ever
possible no thought must ever be allowed to enter; and in
those cases where we cannot prevent its entrance, we must give

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</span>

them amusements, distractions and other substitutes for thinking.
We must use artifice, not force; we must lure, not compel;
for force and compulsion would defeat our aim by causing them,
through the grievance they would thereby have against us, to
begin thinking most grievously; whereas, by fooling them
into going, of their own accord, in the way we want them to go,
we would accomplish our object, and at the same time leave
them to feel that they are free and independent dogs&mdash;which is
to be done every time.”</p>

<p>“Therefore we do advise that the Board of Public Safety devise
all manner of anti-thinking devices, and put them in operation
at once, for there is no time to lose. History shows that
wherever the empire of fleas over dogs has been overthrown, it
has always been due to the neglect of the fleas, of those times,
to keep up to due efficiency the anti-thinking devices of those
times. Remember, we beseech you, that eternal vigilance in
keeping the dogs from thinking, is the price of your rule over
them.</p>

<p>“Now, the most efficacious anti-thinking remedy, is hard
work, and eternal plenty of it. Give the dogs plenty to do.
Make the pace fast and furious, and cause them to hustle to
stay their hunger, and take all means to make their hunger
get ahead of their hustling; cause them to have to scratch from
early morn to midnight, so that the moment they’ve done
work for the night, they will fall asleep from fatigue, and
never wake until it is high time to be at their scratching again.
Make leisure impossible, and idleness synonymous with starvation,
and we give you our word of guarantee, that the dogs will
soon be on the way to recovery.</p>

<p>“But, as interminable work alone, although a most excellent&mdash;and
the main&mdash;remedy for thinking, would in the end sour
their minds and enfeeble their bodies, and so reduce their yield
of blood&mdash;thus defeating the main purpose for which a wise
Creator created them, and predisposing them to crime and
wickedness&mdash;a certain amount of recreation <i>must</i> be allowed

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span>

them. In this need of recreation lies their only danger. They
must not be allowed much recreation; for much would give
them time to think&mdash;which must be especially guarded against.
They must have so little recreation that their exhaustion shall
incline them only to amusements.</p>

<p>“But, in the reaction from the exhaustion of toil, they will be
apt to seek mad, unhealthy, delirious and body-weakening
amusements. Therefore, it behooveth you to provide that their
amusements be both recuperative and anti-thinking. Lo! We
have spoken.”</p>

<p>And this advice of the wise fleas seemed good and sage unto
the other fleas; and the Monstrous Fleas (all but Pharaoh
Phrique, who became sulky and declared that the wise fleas
were a lot of old fogy fools not to see that to hang, shoot,
choke and kill the pesky dogs was the shortest, quickest and
altogether the most efficacious way of putting them down),
said, that come to think of it, they believed that eternal work
<i>was</i> the finest antidote to the thinking poison, that had been
devised, for they had noticed that though their dogs that
turned the great Handle had at various times displayed alarming
symptoms of the thought disease, they were happy to say
they, by the application of the perpetual-work remedy, were
now almost cured; and they believed that with care in keeping
them eternally at it, they would suffer no relapse.</p>

<p>So the fleas formed the Board of Public Safety. And the first
thing they did was to send a committee unto McPoodle, commanding
him to provide them gangs of police and other dogs,
to go by night through all the highways and byways of Canisville,
and rake up all the bones and scraps and broken victuals
they could find, in order that the dogs in the morning might
have to scratch long and furiously to find a mouthful.</p>

<p>And McPoodle did as he was commanded, and sent his well-fed
police and other dogs out to make the working dogs hungry.
And they raked and scraped the highways and the byways, and
gathered up all the food there was to be seen, and sorted the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</span>

various scraps into heaps, and carried every heap into a Corner
by itself.</p>

<p>And the fleas commanded McPoodle, and he appointed a few
of the most eminent fleas to be Trustees and custodians over
each heap.</p>

<p>And on the day of appointment those Trustees and custodians
did reverently lift up their eyes to heaven, and say they
accepted the custody thereof, as a sacred Trust from God and
McPoodle, and did solemnly vow that they would administer
that Trust in the fear of God, and altogether in the interest of
the dogs, to whom they had a deep and heartfelt desire to make
victuals cheap. This, said they, not because they loved the
dogs, but because they had the Corners and could afford to lie.</p>

<p>Then came to pass all that had been predicted by the wise
fleas. The dogs hungrily ran about the bare streets, seeking
food, but found nothing but a few chance scraps, that had
escaped the vigilant diligence of McPoodle’s sweepers. So
ravenous was their hunger, and so scarce the means of satisfying
it, that the dogs’ noses were ever in the dirt, and grew sore
and bloody with their eternal nosing after the Something that
so seldom they found. As for their eyes, they grew, by reason
of being ever strained towards the dirt, to be permanently near-sighted
and microscopic, so that larger things, such as hills
and trees and sky became indistinct and almost invisible to
them. And as for their brains, they shrank and shrivelled
until they could only receive one thought, and that was&mdash;Victuals.</p>

<p>So that the fleas rejoiced, and were glad, and the wise fleas
were held in great honor for having devised so great a salvation
from the threatened perils of the thinking plague.</p>

<p>And the wise fleas warned the eminent and the wealthy fleas,
to be sure to retain the advantage they had gained, and keep
the dogs well starved, for nothing kept a dog’s brain so thoroughly
fortified against the invasion of uplifting and seditious
thoughts, as perpetual hunger and tearing around to appease it.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span>

And the eminent and the wealthy fleas said they would see
to it with pleasure.</p>

<p>But, by and by, after many dogs had dropped dead in their
vain struggling search for victuals in the cleaned-out highways
and byways, the hungry dogs were compelled to repair to the
Corners, and beg of the fleas that held the heaps as a Sacred
Trust from God, to give them a mouthful for God’s sake to
keep them from dying.</p>

<p>But the lordly fleas that had the Sacred Trust, spake haughtily
unto them, and said that as Heaven had most wisely seen fit, by
means of the Sacred Trust, to give the fleas the Bulge on the
dogs, they were determined to be faithful to Heaven, and use
the said Bulge to the glory of Heaven, and the safety of Society
which had but very recently been in peril of destruction, and,
therefore, none but good and moral, lowly and obedient dogs,
that had never held seditious thoughts, had never tried, or
thought of trying, to shake off their fleas, had never doubted or
been tempted to doubt, the divine and indisputable right of fleas
to suck the blood of dogs, would receive any scraps from the
heaps which had been committed to them&mdash;the Sacred Trustees.</p>

<p>And all the hungry dogs hastened to assure the Sacred Trustees
that they were and always had been good and moral,
obedient and unseditious dogs that had never doubted the divine
rights of fleas.</p>

<p>But the Sacred Trustees said that was not so, for they had a
Holy Angel who kept a Book of Death, in which was written
with everlasting ink, the names of those undesirable dogs whom
certain sneak dogs, called Detectives, had reported to them to
have been guilty of thinking and speaking evil of fleas; and
these had been Blacklisted, to be sent away into everlasting
hunger.</p>

<p>Upon which they commanded the Angel to read out the
names of the Accused; who were ignominiously driven shrieking
away, by the police dogs who, being fat and well fed, did
drive them away with pleasure, and club them with alacrity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>But the Blessed Ones, whose names were not written in the
Book of Death, did cringingly wag their tails, and lick the feet
of the police dogs, and reverentially pray their good lords, the
Sacred Trustees, to give them something to push the walls of
their stomachs apart with, for they were fallen together with
hunger. Thereupon, the Sacred Trustees were graciously
pleased to order certain servant dogs to throw over the fence
just scraps enough <i>not to be sufficient to go around</i>, and to keep
the dogs avidiously scrambling and savagely fighting for them.</p>

<p>This policy, said the wise fleas, would keep the dogs’ thoughts
in their stomachs, where alone dogs’ thoughts ought to be; for
when they mounted to their heads they rendered dogs bad citizens
and of no good to the fleas.</p>

<p>And it was so that the dogs grew unable and unwilling to
think of anything but the horrible and ever enlarging vacuum
in their insides, and of what to fling into it.</p>

<p>So the plague was stayed.</p>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>TRULY the plague of thinking was stayed, but a peril
took its place which the over-jubilant fleas had
overlooked. For the dogs, by reason of the intensifying
of their hunger by the Cornering of all the
means of life by the Sacred Trustees, began to develop
a hunger madness that took on the form of
blind and unthinking violence.</p>

<p>Now that the fleas had succeeded so well in keeping the dogs’
thoughts down in their stomachs, and out of their heads, the
dogs acted from stomach alone, and in a way most disappointing
and discouraging to the fleas. They had ceased to think, certainly,
but what they lacked in thought they made up in feeling,
and went blindly at anything that might appease their awful
hunger. They tore and killed and ate one another, and, in their
indiscriminating rage, ate even some fleas; and so meagre and
skinny did they become that their yield of blood very sensibly
diminished, insomuch that thousands of little fleas shrivelled up
and died, and divers of the eminent and large fleas grew slack
around the paunch.</p>

<p>In this extremity the fleas sent again for the wise fleas, and
said: “Alas! what shall we do? for the remedy is worse than
the disease; we have cured the dogs of thinking and seditiousness,
but thereby our Dividends have shrunk, and many of our

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>

beloved friends have died. Better had we taken the risk of
sedition than have brought on this state of things. Your advice
was not good.”</p>

<p>But the wise fleas replied: “Ye did overdo the matter. Told
we not you that ye must not quite kill the dogs that are your
life? Ye ought to have given them food and rest and recreation
enough to have kept up their blood-yielding efficiency. Ye
have been great fools. Ye can only carry the keeping-busy
remedy to a certain point; beyond that it must be supplemented
by a wise bamboozlement. The two must be worked together
in proper proportion. Neither alone is all-sufficient; ye can
neither treat them altogether with perpetual toil and scramble,
nor with perpetual bamboozlement; but the two combined and
worked in concert will bring ye full salvation.</p>

<p>“Now, therefore, for the future be wise, and appoint ye a
Bamboozling Committee, and let those who are by special fitness
appointed to keep the dogs hungry and on the eternal trot note
well the exact point at which they require a recuperating respite&mdash;that
is, a holiday&mdash;and then let the Bamboozlers come on and
take charge of them while they rest. Thus shall the dogs be
beautifully passed alternately from the Hunger Makers to the
Bamboozlers, and from the Bamboozlers to the Hunger Makers,
and they shall beautifully be preserved in health and utter
idiocy.”</p>

<p>And the fleas said: “How and where shall we find the Bamboozlers
ye recommend?”</p>

<p>The wise fleas replied: “That is easy; there are lots of them
about, of one sort or another. Let the Boards of Public Health
and Safety seek out fleas that have large understanding of and
are learned in the science and art of elegant fooling and beautiful
lying, that are exceedingly skillful of mouth, and can be depended
on at a moment’s notice at any time to demonstrate with
all-convincing persuasiveness that black is white, that darkness
is light, and evil good, and can do this most amusingly, and let
these be appointed a Bamboozling Committee to devise all

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>

manner of amusements and bamboozlements for the dogs, that
shall occupy their holiday moments and make them happy.
Let your motto be: ‘Eternal bamboozlement is the price of
Safety.’ We have spoken.”</p>

<p>And the advice of the wise fleas seemed good unto the other
fleas, and they commanded the Board of Public Safety to diligently
search out such as had great skill in bamboozlement.
And the Board of Public Safety did so; and at the end of seven
days the eminent and wealthy fleas gathered themselves together
to hear how the Board of Public Safety had done.</p>

<p>And the Board of Public Safety made report thus: “Most
eminent and wealthy fleas: According to your order and commandment
we have gone through all Canisville and the country
roundabout, and have sought diligently for those fleas that have
the gift of elegant lying and bamboozling. For several days we
sought without success. Truly, we found liars in plenty; in
fact, we found most fleas were good all-round common liars;
many of them proffered themselves for our service, and were exceedingly
anxious to serve their country, but we told them that
although we had the highest respect for their ability as common
liars, and had the highest appreciation of their zealous desire to
perform their duty on all common occasions, we were just now
confronted with an uncommon peril which demanded uncommon
and extraordinary liars that could rise to the level of the
emergency and save the country. Some of them did even throw
contempt on our mission, saying there was no necessity for all
this nonsense of a Bamboozling Committee; that for their part
they considered the good old-fashioned way of bleeding dogs to
death quite good enough for the good-for-nothing, lazy things;
that they would not condescend to bamboozle them at all, but
would just have all the discontented and violent ones killed as a
warning and example to the rest. But we told them that they
knew not what manner of spirit they were of, and went our way;
and with the blessing of God we at last found a most elegant flea,
of very great modesty, that had in the very highest degree the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>

very gifts we were in search of. This flea, we found, was burying
his talents in a napkin, and hiding his light under a bushel, and
wasting his skill of mouth at dinner parties, where he was frittering
away his gifts, that ought to belong to the whole nation, on
a small circle of friends whom he made to be merry and laugh.
His name, we ascertained, is Chancy Mountebank Dephool
Flea, and we found that he has the very highest reputation
amongst those who know him as an amuser and speaker of buncombe,
and we recommend that he be appointed head and
president of the Bamboozling Committee, with power to select
his own associates and co-workers.”</p>

<p>And the Board of Public Safety did according to the recommendation
of the wise fleas, and appointed Chancy Mountebank
Dephool Flea to be the organizer and president of the Bamboozling
Committee, which position he was delighted to accept,
he being, as he said, only too happy to do what he could towards
saving Society.</p>

<p>And Chancy Mountebank called unto him immediately Andronicus
Carnivorous: “For,” said he, “he is the most uncommon
liar, bamboozler and hypocrite we have;” and Wilhelm
Bunkum Mak Tinley: “For,” said he, “he is a very good dog
fooler, although somewhat clumsy withal;” and Harry Bambuzle
Grandadhat: “For,” said he, “he can say many fine and
beautiful things that are not so.”</p>

<p>And the Committee met at once and proceeded to devise bamboozlements;
but they had not proceeded far when Wilhelm
Bunkum Mak Tinley Flea arose and said: “Respected President
and Fellow Bamboozlers: we have committed a great omission
and oversight; we have left out of the composition of this Committee
the most transcendently glorious hifalutor, fictionist and
bamboozler of all ages and of all countries. I mean our most
eminent Canisvillian, the Reverend Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite.
Of course he is only a barking dog, and as such may be
technically disqualified from serving on a committee of fleas,
but having regard to his extraordinary and astonishing gifts of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>

mouth, and his tremendous abilities to dress up the plainest lies
in the habiliments of the most gorgeous and resplendent truths,
I think we ought by all means to have him made one of us, for
no Bamboozling Committee can be complete without him. I
submit that he is equal even to you, respected President.”</p>

<p>And President Chancy Mountebank Dephool Flea said: “It
is indeed a most astounding piece of forgetfulness and stupidity
on our part, not to have thought of our friend De Little Wit
Blatherskite. I thank our good brother Mak Tinley Flea for
reminding us.”</p>

<p>So the Committee went in a body to ask De Little Wit Blatherskite
to be one of them, and they made profuse apologies for the
slight they had unwittingly put upon him. And the Blatherskite
was pleased to accept their apologies; and he went along with
them.</p>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>HAVING secured the invaluable Blatherskite, the
Bamboozling Committee met very early in the
morning, and President Chancy Mountebank
Dephool Flea, in calling the Committee to
order, said: “Brother Bamboozlers, it is laid
upon us to save this our beloved land. As ye know, the Board of
Public Safety has appointed us to work together with the Hunger
Makers in keeping the dogs from thinking. To them, ye
know, is appointed the duty of bleeding them within an inch of
their lives, and keeping them so busy trying to catch up with
their hunger that they will never have a moment to think
a serious thought; and to us is appointed the duty of
entertaining them during their moments of absolutely needful
recreation, and keeping them so well amused that they shall
have neither wish nor time to think.</p>

<p>“I need not tell you that the Hunger Makers are doing their
duty <i>con amore</i>; so well that in their enthusiasm they are apt
to overdo it. It behooves us therefore, to as well deserve our
laurels as they do theirs. Where shall we begin, therefore?”</p>

<p>Then arose Wilhelm Bunkum Mak Tinley Flea, and said:
“I move, respected President, that we recommend Pup McPoodle
and the authorities to proclaim certain days to be legal holidays,
and days of recreation for the dogs, and that on those

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span>

days the dogs be gathered together, when we will each take a
turn in amusing and edifying them. I will take one turn, and I
flatter myself that during my turn, I can demonstrate to them
then the moon is made of green cheese; then our much beloved
brother, Andronicus Carnivorous, shall take another; my dear
chum, Harry Grandadhat shall take a third; you, most excellent
humbug, shall take a fourth, and our ever-ready old
stand-by and reverend barker, Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite,
who is always bursting big and full with gorgeous gush, and
perennially on tap, shall fill up all other intervals.”</p>

<p>Andronicus arose and said: “I crave permission to second the
motion of my brother Bunkum Mak Tinley Flea. It is good.
I deprecate the ascription to me of any very great ability in the
line of bamboozling. I have the highest pleasure in yielding the
palm to you, dear Mountebank Dephool, and to the superlative
Blatherskite, in having whom with us we are blessed and
honored above measure. For my part I am but a superficial,
transparent, and inferior sort of every-day liar, with no ability,
like you, my dear colleagues, to palm off on the dogs a lie as
the most sacred Gospel truth; but I do modestly claim that I
possess a very creditable ability to play the hypocrite; I believe
everyone who knows me admits <i>that</i>; but, be my talents
what they may, I am willing to consecrate them all to the good
of the dogs and the salvation of this, my adopted country.”</p>

<p>This motion was carried, and presented to the Board of Public
Safety; and the Board carried it to McPoodle and the authorities,
and they, with the acquiescence of the fleas&mdash;who had all
been assured that they would be indemnified for any loss of
blood they might suffer in case of failure of the experiment&mdash;proclaimed
that on a certain few days of the year, the fleas
should let up on the dogs and allow them to recover a little
strength; and that on those days they should turn over the
management of the dogs to the Bamboozling Committee.</p>

<p>And the Bamboozling Committee got together certain dogs
that were lying around loose, and made them happy with meat

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>

and drink, and dressed them up in gaudy colored raiment; and
to some of them they gave certain loud-noise-producing instruments,
and to others, long poles with pretty cloths fluttering at
the end thereof, and said unto them: “Go ye forth into all the
streets and ways of Canisville, and the country roundabout,
and blow ye and thump ye on the loud-noise-producing instruments,
and wave ye on high the pretty cloths, and make a great
shouting and hullabaloo with your throats; and it shall be that
when the dogs of Canisville shall hear your hullabaloo, they
will run out of their holes and kennels, and, forgetting all their
troubles, they will howl with idiotic joy, and run after you
whithersoever ye go. Go roundabout and encompass the town
seven times, blowing and thumping and waving, and fetch up
at the Public Place, where great miracles are to be wrought.”</p>

<p>So the blowing, thumping and cloth-waving dogs, quite intoxicated
with the strange, glorious feeling of a full stomach, did
as they were bid, and went and filled all the air with their
sounding; and at the very first blast and thump and shout, all
the dogs that heard came rushing out, barking, wagging
their bony tails and rolling over and over in the dirt, with a
frenzied joy, and followed in a great mob the blowers and
thumpers and wavers, whithersoever they went.</p>

<p>Then when they had seven times gone roundabout the town,
they came to the Public Place, where were gathered on an eminence
the Bamboozling Committee, and around them, in their
best raiment, all the Monstrous Fleas, who had ordered the
Blood and Bones Grinding Mill to cease its bloody grind for a
day; all the wealthy and eminent fleas, all the pious and holy
fleas; and all the salaried barkers were there; the Holy One a
Maker of long prayers and short wages, was there; and also
Lovely Anthony the Dog Catcher, the One-eyed Elder Berry,
and all the morality cobblers, dog thumpers and compulsionists
of every society; and all were sleek and fat and well-to-do,
and smiled most heavenly smiles, for they felt that God had
blessed the very first part of their new scheme of salvation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Then arose and whispered Chancy Mountebank Dephool
Flea to the Reverend Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite, “Brother,
this is a gorgeous success so far; thou art the gifted one; open
thou the Bamboozle.”</p>

<p>And the Reverend Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite stepped
briskly to the front, and with a voice of tragedy delivered himself
thus:</p>

<p>“A vision, a vision, a vision of Judgment. It is the last day&mdash;the
day of the final fruition of all things; the day when all
the seed sowings of all the countless centuries since time was,
have reached their harvest. With mine eye I can see a countless
multitude of dogs gathered to the Judgment, rising tier on tier,
from the lowermost valley to the topmost height of every hill
and mountain. From every clime and country they come,
swarm on swarm, mob on mob, gathered by a mighty trumpet
summons there is no disobeying. They come from the East;
they come from the West; they come from the North; they
come from the South; from the frosty land of the midsummer
midnight sun, where white death locketh all things in his eternal
embrace, to the torrid equatorial regions of perpetual
frizzle and fry; from the balmy lands of the fig and the
olive, where the spicy snifters, and odoriferous breezes of the
Southern seas gently woo both soul and body to gentle doziness,
to the blizzard smitten lands of the Occidental North,
where the circumvolutory cyclone whirligiggeth, and the domiciliary
dwelling place fleeth violently away with all the inhabitants
thereof; from the land of the azure firmament, the
emerald sea and opalescent atmosphere, and the land of the
perennial asthmatic brumosity&mdash;from everywhere they come,
host on host, multitude on multitude.</p>

<p>“The Judgment call is heard; the Judgment is set; the books
are opened. The sun goes out; the moon explodes and becomes
blood; the omniflatulent wind roareth; the stars fall to earth
in a fiery hail; the heavens shrivel up in an awful incandescence,
as a burning scroll; the earth rocks, and quakes, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span>

groans and cracks, and sends forth lurid and sulphureous flames
and fumes and infernal stench. The comets, with their flaming
tails, all snarled together, stagger like drunken celestials
amongst their inextricably mixed aphelia, perihelia, and syzygy,
and falling over the planetary orbits, drive their occupants to
distractedly demand, ‘Where are we at?’”</p>

<p>“The ocean’s great breast heaves and throbs with huge conglomerate
convulsions, and dashing o’er its divinely appointed
bounds, engulfs the world. The rivers everywhere rear up on
end, stiff with an infinite fright. The lengthy Mississippi, the
breadthy, many-mouthed Amazon, the hoary Ganges, the unfiltered
Missouri, the holy Jordan, swash and writhe together in
mid-air in an amazed intertwining. The lightnings gleam, the
thunders roar, the whole creation groaneth. The planets,
breaking loose from the centripetal force that swung them
around their solar center, clash and crash together in celestial
smash and wreck. Crash, crash, crash, in answering reverberations,
from utmost bound to utmost bound of the universe.</p>

<p>“And over all the din and rip and roar and clash and terror,
cometh a clarion blast of an angelic trump, ‘Ho! Ho!! Ho!!!
Attend, all ye dogs; for the end, the eternal end that shall
never be cut off, cometh. Give ear unto the voice of the Eternal
Verdict.’</p>

<p>“And there cometh forth from the infinite profundities of the
tenebrious immensities, a Voice of ten thousand-million-thunder
power, in direful proclamation, saying:</p>

<p>“‘All dogs to the Judgment. Crowns of glory, eternal joy
and everlasting fullness unto all dogs that on earth have done
righteously, have walked humbly in the fear of God, and reverenced
His anointed ones, the fleas; and have paid unto them
their just and Heaven-ordained dues; that have not blasphemed
them, or called in question the righteousness of their doings;
that have counted poverty their highest honor. Blessed are
they that have hungered, that the fleas might be filled; that
have gone naked, that the fleas might be clothed; that have

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span>

died, that the fleas might live; that have grovelled in darkness
and filth, that the fleas might dwell in honor and wealth.
Great is now their reward, and they shall now themselves be
lifted up on high and glorified for duty done.’</p>

<p>“‘But woe and desolation to the disobedient, discontented and
unrighteous dogs that have growled against the divine ordination
of their lives and lots; that have cursed their hunger and
nakedness; that have spoken blasphemy against the fleas, and
the Constitution and Laws of Canisville, and poked the blasphemous
nose of Inquiry into the inscrutable and not-to-be-inquired-into
wisdom of the divine ordination of dogs and fleas.
No crowns for them, no joy, no fullness. It is decreed that they
go down to Hell with Satan and Wilyumtwede.’</p>

<p>“At the pronouncement of this sentence the million-instrumented
orchestra of the spheres crashes out a mighty ‘Amen.’
The morning stars clap their hands with joy; the evening and
the midnight stars take up the cue, and flash it on from star to
star; it rings from system to system, from universe to universe,
until from farthest nebula to farthest nebula, the whole creation
pulses and thrills and vibrates with the tintinnabulous
acclaim. The heavens open, and amid a deluge of unapproachable
light, the worthy dogs with p&aelig;ans of victorious joy, are
caught up thereto; while Hell beneath opens wide its yawning
jaws, and the unrighteous and disobedient dogs, amid thunder
and lightning, go howling down, down, down, in an everlasting
and ever accelerating descent, to the place of unutterable torment
and fiery woe.”</p>

<p>At this mighty outburst of luridly pyrotechnical eloquence,
the great crowd of dogs turned deadly pale and faint; and they
turned guiltily, each to his neighbor, and said, “He means us;”
“Ain’t it awful?” “God forgive us, we must never repine or
speak evil of fleas any more.”</p>

<p>And many of the dogs there, being wasted and weak for want
of food, could not stand the terror of the Blatherskite’s portrayal,
and several of the most famished and an&aelig;mic among

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span>

them, trembled and tottered and fell dead, and had to be carried
off to the morgue; which the bystanders declared must have
been intended of Heaven, as a sample and small installment of
the threatened Judgment.</p>

<p>And the assembled fleas nudged one another, and remarked unctuously
that the Bamboozle was working very successfully so far, and was
certainly being very much blessed of Heaven, to the touching up of the
consciences of the dogs. The Holy One a Maker of long prayers and short
wages, rolled up his seventh-day eye to heaven, and said: “We fleas
have much to be thankful for in the gift to us of the Blatherskite.”
Harry Grandadhat exclaimed: “Society is saved!” And President Chancy
Mountebank Dephool Flea winked an eye at de Little Wit Blatherskite
as he resumed his seat, and whispered to him: “Brother&mdash;dog
only though thou art&mdash;I love thee; thou hast excellently done;
this day&mdash;thanks to the might of thy facile and well lubricated
jaw&mdash;is salvation come to the fleas of Canisville; thou hast in
thine effort this day exceeded and more than justified the Committee’s
highest expectation of thee; the Bamboozle prospereth.”</p>

<p>THEN arose President Chancy Mountebank Dephool
Flea, and, after telling his flea friends in a cautionary
whisper not to laugh or in any other way “give
away” the Bamboozle, advanced with a hop, a skip
and a jump to the front and ordered the loud-noise-producing
instruments to play up, and the pretty
cloths to be waved on high, which, having been done, quite
took away the sadness of the dogs and put them in great good
humor. Then he stood on his head, and danced on one leg, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>

turned several somersaults backwards and forwards, and grinned
and smiled, and told the dogs some very facetious stories and
jokes, which caused them to howl with delirious joy, and declare
that that day was the happiest one they had known in many
years, and that Chancy Mountebank was, without exception,
the funniest fool of a flea they had ever seen, God bless him.</p>

<p>Then he walked upside down across the stage, which made
the dogs howl still more, and then advanced to the front and
said to the dogs:</p>

<p>“Fellow citizens of this great and prosperous country [great
surprise amongst the dogs and much winking amongst the Bamboozlers
and other fleas], the highly favored of heaven and the
envy of the whole world [great astonishment of the dogs as the
fact dawns upon them], land of the free and home of the brave
[uncontrollable tittering amongst the Bamboozling Committee
as they lower their heads to hide it, and remarks: “aint he a
dandy?” “he’s away ahead of you, brother Blatherskite, in the
art of dog fooling,” and “the Lord is with us,” from One a Maker
of long prayers]. My theme to-day is Liberty, glorious Liberty.
My dear fellow citizens, ye have no idea of the incomparable
heritage of honor and glory and blessing ye have in the fact
that ye have been born and are privileged to live in this wonderful
free town and country [tremendous agitation and delight
amongst the dogs at this new discovery, which, coming upon
their empty stomachs, caused several of the more famished and
attenuated to drop dead].</p>

<p>“The very fact that ye were born to freedom, and have been
used to it all your lives, renders you unable to properly appreciate
your incomparable blessing; for, as the proverbs have it, ‘The
blessings we have we value not,’ and ‘We never value the water
till the well runs dry.’ Our beloved fellow citizens there, who
have just fallen dead, would have been alive now had they daily
habituated themselves to thankfulness and the proper estimation
of their privileges. But if ye had had the opportunities as I
have had of comparing your lot in this highly favored land, with

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span>

that of the dogs in the rest of the world beyond the pond, your
hearts would swell to bursting with infinite gratitude, and your
tongues, attuned to thankfulness, would wag with an everlasting
<i>Jubilate Deo</i>. [Tears of remorse and penitence well up in the
eyes of the dogs at this, and cries of “Lord, make us more
thankful,” are heard everywhere, while Grandadhat and Mak
Tinley snicker and tickle each other, and ask Carnivorous what
he thinks of “Our Chancy,” to which Andronicus replies, “I
envy him; his polished and elegant way of lying is as far above
my coarse and clumsy way as the smoothness of velvet is above
the roughness of sandpaper.” And One a Maker of long
prayers, says, “It’s as good as a Means of Grace.”]</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear fellow citizens, ye know that I am the flea that goeth
and cometh over the pond every year. For many years I have regarded it
as a sacred duty I owe to God and my beloved native country, to go away
over the pond every Summer, partly, and as a minor consideration, to
recruit my health and obtain a little rest from my terribly exhausting
duty of making myself and certain of my fellow fleas wealthy&mdash;oh,
my beloved dogs, ye have not the slightest idea of what it is to bear
the burdens and responsibilities of being rich [a voice far away to the
rear: “True, true”], and the tremendous strain and wear and tear of
brain and body it costs to make wealth. Be thankful that God has not
called you to the task [the voice in the rear: “You’ll take care that
God doesn’t call us to that!” Confusion, and cries of “Put him out!” and
anxious looks on the countenances of the fleas.]</p>

<p>“As I was saying when that unseemly interruption took place,
I go over the pond, partly, and as a minor consideration, for my
health, but primarily, and as a major consideration, that I may
look upon and impress upon my mind the horrible misery,
poverty, destitution and enslavement of the masses of dogs in
the foreign countries. Oh, how dreadful it is there! Hunger
is the perpetual condition. Rapacious, cruel, merciless rulers
tax them to death. Between rich and poor there is a great gulf

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>

fixed, so that those who are born poor dogs live and die poor.
In those dark and enslaved countries a dog knows he is a dog,
and can never rise to be anything higher. Such instances as
that of our fellow citizen and friend, Andronicus Carnivorous,
who began life here as a low-down dog, and by dint of industry,
skill and the boundless opportunities which we in this country
offer to all, lifted himself up from the rank in which he was
born, and became transformed into as big a sucker as any of us,
could never happen there, where opportunities of dogs to rise in
the world and become Suckers are by infamous class laws denied
them. But here in this enlightened land, where we have no
kings, and by that <i>ne plus ultra</i> of all wisdom, the Constitution,
fleas and dogs, rich and poor, black and white, are all equal; the
opportunities for advancement are countless and open to each
and all, and if any dog is poor and hungry, it is all the fault of
his own incompetency and laziness.</p>

<p>“In this great free land there is not&mdash;there cannot be&mdash;any
unrighteous wealth [a look of superlative virtue on Andronicus’
countenance, and a glory on the transfigured face of One a Maker
of long prayers and short wages, as he rolls up his seventh-day
eye towards heaven]. The very fact that one has wealth is proof
absolute that the possessor thereof deserves it, since the opportunity
to acquire is open equally to all. <i>Every dog</i> may in this
free country, by dint of virtue and industry, become an eminent
and wealthy sucker and have thousands of dogs for his nourishment
[puzzled looks of hope and new encouragement on the
faces of the dogs as they try, mentally, to comprehend the
glorious possibility of <i>every</i> dog doing that; and Grandadhat
mutters to De Little Wit Blatherskite: “My, but Chancy gave
them a stiff ’un to swallow then,” and the Blatherskite replies:
“Truly he did, my brother, but he is the joker that can do it.”]</p>

<p>“Yes, my noble fellow citizens, my whole object in going
every year across the pond is, as I said, that I may see the hell
of degradation dogs have over there, and become horrified, so
that at the end of my sojourn I am so disgusted at the inequalities

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>

and class distinctions, and the brutal tyranny of the rich
over the poor, that I am properly grateful to God for the precious
privileges He has given us here, and am profoundly thankful to
get back again to Home, Home, Sweet, Sweet Home, for there’s
no place like Home, be it ever so humble, like Home, Sweet
Home.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear friends, you have not the slightest idea of the
disgust with which those annual four months’ contemplation of
foreign poverty, tyranny, aristocracy and royalty fill my soul,
neither can ye conceive the agony of impatience that then takes
possession of me to tread again the soil of my native land, this
land, whose pure, sweet air of Freedom is instant death to every
form of injustice and tyranny; where the inalienable right of
every dog to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed
to him by the Constitution and equal laws; where, under
the folds of the Flag that makes us free, every dog dwells in
peace, plenty and safety, none daring to make him afraid; land
where there are no kings, lords or castes of any sort; where
dogs and fleas breathe the common air of Heaven; land of the
pilgrim’s pride, land where our fathers died [the voice in the
rear again: “Yes, and where their children are dying of starvation.”
Confusion, and a spasm of fear amongst the fleas, and
cries of “Put him out”], from every mountain side let Freedom
ring.</p>

<p>“Oh, my fellow citizens, I advise every one of you to save up
and perform the sacred duty of going over the pond every
Summer and getting horrified with the sight of foreign poverty
and tyranny, so that ye may come home loaded to the very
muzzle with thankfulness to God that He has so mercifully
chosen us from amongst the dogs of the earth to shower His
infinite bounties on. Nothing has such a tendency to make
noble, thankful citizens of this grandest of all grand republics
as going abroad for a few months during the hot weather.”</p>

<p>At the close of this grand piece of bamboozling oratory, the
dogs made a supreme effort, and gave a grand howl of acclaim

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>

that made the welkin ring, and caused several passing clouds
to burst into rain by reason of the concussion. The loud-noise-producing
instruments started up, the pretty cloths were waved
on high, and everything proclaimed the mad delight of the dogs
at the wonderful discovery by their lean and famine-devoured
selves that they were all free and equal, and the particular pets
of Heaven.</p>

<p>With the exception of a few growlers at the rear, who audibly
remarked that “If God had given them less Freedom and more
Victuals it would have looked better of Him,” and who were
promptly hustled out of the crowd, all the dogs were delighted,
and declared that Chancy Mountebank Dephool Flea was the
finest and most elegant truth-teller in the world and should
henceforth be honored as “Our Chancy.” And as he took his
seat the whole Committee of Bamboozlers, and all the other fleas,
congratulated him that there were no flies on him either, and
One a Maker of long prayers and short wages, groaning within
himself, lifted up his seventh-day eye and said: “Verily the
Lord is this day blessing us with a great salvation,” to which
De Little Wit Blatherskite responded: “Yea, verily, brother;
blessing us copiously. And why not, brother? <i>We</i> are his
people, and the sheep of his pasture.”</p>

<p>WHEN Chancy Mountebank Dephool Flea had
got through with his highly successful oration,
he ordered the loud-noise-producing instruments
to strike up their loudest, and the pretty
cloths to be waved on high with the greatest
vigor, in order to keep up the effect that had
been produced, and to scare away from the doorways
of the dogs’ brains, any sober reflections
that might, perchance, be seeking entrance there;
and at a given signal, a very large and pretty cloth&mdash;which
until then, had been kept hidden&mdash;having on it a number of
white spots and red streaks, was run up to the top of a tall pole
and thrown to the breeze. Whereupon, the whole multitude of
the fleas, rose up, and prostrated themselves to it, crying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Hail! All Hail! All Holy Flag,</div>
    <div class="verse">Source of our life, we bow to thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The Flag, the Flag, the Flag of the Free,</div>
    <div class="verse">The Flag of the dog, and Flag of the flea.”</div>
   </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And there came a great darkness over all the land; and the
atmosphere was suffused with ghostly green and yellow lights,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>

that cast a lurid gloom over the whole assembly; and out of
the darkness there came lightnings and a voice of thunder,
saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“Who doubteth that this is the Flag of the Free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And boweth not down, thrice cursed be he.”</div>
   </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And all the multitude of the fleas, cried out in chorus,
“Amen.”</p>

<p>By this time, all the poor dogs were shaking like leaves in
the breeze, and they cried out: “What shall we do? What
shall we do?”</p>

<p>And the voice thundered again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“Bow down, bow down to the Flag of the Free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Bow down, and thank God for sweet Liberty.”</div>
   </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And all the multitude of the prostrate fleas, cried out again
in chorus: “Aye! Bow down.”</p>

<p>And again the ghostly lights flashed, and all manner of solemn
and awful noises were heard.</p>

<p>And the dogs being dazed and dazzled and confused with the
awful sights and sounds, began everywhere to fall down and
worship the Flag, and, catching the enthusiasm, they soon were
shouting as loud as they could, which with many of them was
not very loud; for they were so hungry and weak that their
breath failed them, but they did the best they could.</p>

<p>Then was lifted up the voice of the Reverend Tee de Little
Wit Blatherskite, proclaiming: “Let there now be a time of
silent lifting up of the heart in thanksgiving to God for this
our Flag, the most glorious on earth, and for these our liberties,
the only real ones on earth.”</p>

<p>And it was so. And there came a solemn hush over all the
bowed assembly, broken only by pious sighs, groans and ejaculations
from the fleas, which, by contagion, was taken up by
the dogs, who were soon sighing and groaning and ejaculating
too, until the air was heavy with a solemn buzz. Then there
blew a holy wind from Heaven, that lifted up the folds of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>

beautiful flag and caused it to wave with solemn flappings most
beautifully; and the solemn darkness began to pass away, to
the accompaniment of low, soft music, as of angel songs stealing
down from Heaven; and the sun shone out in splendor, and
cast his brilliant beams right on the beautiful Flag, that was
transfigured in the glory of it.</p>

<p>Then proclaimed the Reverend Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite&mdash;who
seemed to have naturally become the Master of Ceremonies&mdash;“Brethren,
let us sing:</p>

<p>Then the whole assembly arose, and the loud-noise-producing
instruments joined in. And the fleas being very vigorous, and
fat and strong, lifted up their voices with tremendous energy;
and all the salaried barkers, and the police dogs, and all the
other dogs that were well-fed and rotund of belly, were in good
voice, so that they all sent up a volume of glad sound that
made the air shake and caused the great Flag to give an extra

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>

flap; but the other dogs, being very weak with hunger, and
short of wind, could not do so well, but they, nevertheless,
made a very respectable noise and were very happy.</p>

<p>When the singing was over, the Reverend Tee de Little Wit
Blatherskite lifted up his right paw, commanding attention,
and said: “Brethren, both dogs and fleas&mdash;I may call you
brethren, for beneath the all-encompassing folds of this glorious
Flag, we are all equal [mighty applause from the fleas, echoed
by the dogs]&mdash;I think it would be very appropriate upon this
occasion, and well pleasing to God, to turn this into an experience
meeting; and let each of us testify to the blessings of
Liberty, that our beloved Flag has conferred upon us. Let any
dog or flea get up and speak, for all are equal here. Brother
Grandadhat, suppose you cheer us with your experience.”</p>

<p>Brother Grandadhat, being thus exhorted, arose, and bowing
low to the Flag, said: “I bless God for that Flag, and I bless
God that under its protecting and blessing-scattering folds I
was born, as were my father and my father’s father. I am
proud to live under it. I am proud to boast that from the very
first day, when our fathers first flung it to the breeze, and bade
tyranny fly trembling, with its tail between its legs&mdash;which it
did&mdash;it has been giving us more and more freedom every day,
until now we are the freest, grandest and noblest nation on the
face of the great round globe. Yea, I will go further, and declare
that there is no freedom on earth, save here.</p>

<p>“Brethren, all, God gave us that Flag; it was designed in
Heaven, and God has been ever with it, and acknowledged it
for his own. Never, never, never has it floated&mdash;never, never,
never can it float&mdash;over any wrong, injustice or tyranny.
Under the effulgent splendor of its beautiful white spots and
red streaks, wrong, injustice and tyranny wither and wilt as
would toadstools before the midsummer midday sun. [Tremendous
explosion of applause from the fleas, joined in by the
dogs.] When God gave us that Flag, he, with it, threw wide
open the windows and doors of Heaven, and poured out from

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>

his infinite cornucopi&aelig;, such a deluge of blessings upon us as
no nation on earth ever got or ever will get, and forthwith made
us the pride of ourselves and the envy of the whole world.
[A most awful burst of applause from the fleas, all the fleas
rising up to give it. Several very weak, hungry and woe-begone
dogs, carried away by the whirlwind of excitement, drop
dead of heart failure.]</p>

<div class="figright">

<p>“‘The gifts of God to our people have been so abundant and so
special, that the spirit of devout thanksgiving awaits but the
appointment of a day when it may have a common expression. He has stayed
the pestilence at our door,’ and caused all evil to turn aside from
touching us. ‘He has given us a love for our free civil institutions,’
and grace to abhor and hang all who do not believe we are free, and
dare to say so. ‘He has widened our philanthropy by calls to succor the
distress in other lands; and he has given us’ such ‘a great increase
in material wealth, and’ such ‘a wide diffusion of contentment and
comfort in the homes of our’ dogs, that we are the wonder of the whole
world, and the joy of ourselves. [Grand crescendo of applause from the
fleas, and penitent ejaculations from the dogs of: “Lord, forgive our
past repinings;” “Lord, help us to feel how full we are;” “Lord, take
away our blindness, that our wealth may be disclosed to us;” and much
winking amongst the Bamboozling Committee, at the satisfactory working
of the Bamboozle.] Oh, beloved brethren, ours is <i>the</i> Flag, the <i>only</i>
Flag in the world worth having, and <i>we’ve got it, and don’t
you forget it</i>; [Screams, yells, and deliriums of applause.] the world

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span>

envies us its possession; they would like it, but they shall not have
it; for my part, I will never desert the Flag. No! I will never do it.
It’s of no use asking me. That Flag has blessed me; it has given me
and mine prosperity, so that I am comfortably rotund and fat; it is
the object of my love, my adoration, and I <i>never</i> will desert it; no
ne&mdash;ver. I will not live under any other; so it’s of no use asking
me; I would not take the riches of the whole world for the daily sight
of it; so it’s no use any one offering them to me. I am perfectly happy
now, and I shall go to Heaven when I die. And when the death dew lies
cold on my brow, may my last words be:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse-first-line">‘Oh, Flag of the Free! I would die for thee;</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Emblem of Libertee, Libertee&mdash;ee.’”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And making again obeisance to the emblem, he sat down
amid a thunder of applause, and the hullabaloo of the loud-noise-producing
instruments.</p>

<p>Then spake the Reverend Tee De Little Wit Blatherskite,
“Brethren, that testimony must have done us all good, I am
sure. Will some other good brother favor us with his experience?”</p>

<p>Then stepped forth Andronicus Carnivorous, and, making
three very low obeisances to the Flag, said in a voice low and
broken with emotion: “Brother dogs and fleas: This is the
proudest and solemnest moment of my life. When I look
on that glorious Flag, amongst whose bright spots and broad red
streaks, I can, with my mind’s eye, see, traced in lines of refulgent
brightness, ‘LIFE, LIBERTY, HAPPINESS, EQUALITY,
FRATERNITY,’ my heart swells to bursting with gratitude,
that some God, Providence or other beneficence, did, in
boundless mercy, direct my wandering feet, when a young and
poverty-stricken dog, to the shores of this glorious free land, so
bountifully blest with the milk and honey of prosperity; and
that I was privileged&mdash;for it <i>was</i> a privilege&mdash;to rest and dwell,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>

and make my home under the great broad shadow of that grand
old Flag [making obeisance thereto] of the Free [Flea applause].</p>

<p>“Oh, Brother dogs&mdash;for though that blessed Flag has prospered
me immensely, and made me as corpulent a sucker as the
most monstrous of your fleas, I am not puffed up with pride,
but still deem it my highest honor to count myself as one of
you, and to share with you the dignities of your citizenship.
[Applause from the dogs and a mysterious voice from the rear,
“Yes, but not the hunger of it,” and cries of “Put him out.”]</p>

<p>“Oh, brother dogs, if it is such a blessed privilege to come
in as a ragged stranger, and with the brogue of a foreign dog
on my tongue, under the folds of this Flag, Oh! what must
it be to be born under it, of parents born under it, too! Oh!
I cannot enough congratulate the dogs here, who were thus
blessed, upon the unutterably precious heritage they have
in that fact. Neither can I forgive the irreparable wrong&mdash;unintentional
though it might have been&mdash;my parents did
me, in having brought me into the world in a foreign land,
in the midst of the darkness, heathenism, want, misery and
tyranny that reign wheresoever that Flag fluttereth not.
[Tumultuous applause from dogs and fleas.] Yet, though I
cannot help that wrong, I yield to no dog and no flea in the
width, length, depth and intensity of my love and adoration
of that blessed emblem of the liberty, equality and fraternity
that all enjoy that live under it. Yea, I believe that I, carrying
about with me the agonizing consciousness of my foreign
origin, am more acutely appreciative of the blessedness of living
under it than they who are born under it, and can
claim the Flag as their very own. Often and often am I
amazed that so many of our native dogs seem so little to appreciate
their blessings. Instead of living in a state of perpetual
thankfulness, that they were born and live under this Flag, and
participate in the wealth, protection and liberty it scatters over
all that are worthy, they go about discontented and complaining

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>

of hunger and hard work; and I have often been shocked
by hearing some of these very native dogs say, ‘Damn Flags
when you’ve nothing to eat.’ I think all such dogs are blind
and ungrateful, and should be punished as infidels and blasphemers.
[Applause.]</p>

<p>“Oh, Brethren, I can testify that the Flag has abundantly
blessed <i>me</i>, though a foreigner born. And what I say is, that
what it has done for me, it stands ready to do for all. I love it.
I live for it; I would die for it if need were, and I should
happen to be in the country at the time. I would abide ever
under its great, wide, brooding folds, but that an imperious
and inevitable duty drives me to spend most of my time away
over the pond.</p>

<p>“Like my dear friend, Dephool Flea here, it is with a high
and lofty purpose I go abroad. Upon me is laid the solemn
duty to go and testify to my old kin beyond the pond, what
great things this glorious Flag hath done for my soul and body.
Over there are divers cantankerous and evil-minded carpers
and jibers against our glorious liberties, who allege that our
dogocracy is all snide; our equality all fake; our fraternity all
buncombe and gaseous boast; our liberty all a gorgeous mendacity.
Therefore deem I myself charged with the responsibility
of putting to silence and shame these calumniators, by
frequently dropping myself amongst them, a visible, tangible,
audible proof and specimen of the product of our Flag. It is
laid on me to be the exponent of Triumphant Dogocracy under
the Flag of the Free; and woe is me if I shirk to discharge
this duty.”</p>

<p>“I can understand the pain it gives our beloved Chancy to be
away from under his beloved Flag, three or four months every
year, and the overwhelming joy he always feels in getting back
again; for it is martyrdom to me to be expatriated so long;
but I bear up under it as well as I can, cheered by the reflection
that I have a mission that none but I can fulfill, and that
I am performing the incalculably beneficent service of disseminating

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span>
correct notions about this great country and its Flag, and
creating friendly feeling towards it.”</p>

<p>“When this my duty shall be finally accomplished&mdash;as I
pray it soon may be&mdash;and I shall be privileged to come home
finally, and rest me forevermore under the proud flutter of its
waving, and daily bathe my glad soul in the healing beams of
its shining, then alone shall Andronicus Carnivorous be happy.”
[Immense and prolonged applause, amid which the Bamboozling
Committee get around him, and hug and kiss him. And
the Holy One a Maker of long prayers, regretfully sighs and
says to himself, “Oh, Andy, Andy! One thing only thou lackest.
If thou wert only a Christian, thou wouldst be <i>quite</i>
perfect.”]</p>

<p>HARDLY had Carnivorous resumed his seat, when
there was a great commotion among the fleas
behind. It was caused by Pharaoh Phrique,
upon whom the Spirit of Prophecy had just descended.
Rising, he shouted, “I want to testify.
Oh, I shall burst if I don’t testify.”</p>

<p>To whom De Little Wit Blatherskite said: “Brother, nothing
hinders that thou testify. Come forward then, and testify,
and the Lord be with thee.”</p>

<p>Then Pharaoh Phrique hasted and ran, and tumbled over
several of the other fleas, and having made profound obeisance
to the Flag, he opened his mouth to speak, but he could not;
for a great emotion seized him and shook him, and he wept
with a great weeping greatly. Whereat all the fleas sympathetically
wept also, while all the dogs wondered.</p>

<p>After a short time, however, he found utterance, and in
broken accents began: “Oh, Brethren, dogs and fleas; never
did I fully realize until my beloved partner, Andronicus Carnivorous,
was testifying as to what this, our glorious Flag, had done
for his soul and body, the infinite blessings it brings to us all.
I said to myself, while he was testifying, ‘Oh! If this poor
God-forgotten foreigner, born under a bloody flag, where Liberty
was never heard of, where equality and fraternity are words of
incomprehensible jargon, could come here, and in the space of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span>

a few short years could have his mind so wonderfully enlarged
and ennobled, and his soul so saturated with the sacred principles
of freedom, as he has evidenced to us to-day, Oh! what
a home of Liberty our country must be!’ And, I tell you,
brethren (and it’s a fact we nativeborners may be justly proud
of), this just shows that the very air here is Liberty, by which,
the moment any one breathes it, he is made free. And, above
all, let us remember, and never forget, that WE made this free
air, and this free country; that is, OUR FATHERS and WE.
They laid the foundations of Liberty, roughly and according to
the light they had; but it was, by an all-wise Providence, who
foreknew our coming, reserved unto US&mdash;with our more acute
appreciation of, and more advanced education in, the principles
of true freedom&mdash;to rear therefrom the finished superstructure,
the biggest, grandest, and most gorgeously beautiful Temple of
Liberty the world ever saw.</p>

<p>“And this was all perfectly natural. We are a free people,
and a free people makes free institutions. Freedom with us is
an instinct. It is born in us. It is our atmosphere, our food.
It sticks out all over us. A true born Canisvillian takes to
Liberty more naturally than a duck takes to water. Liberty is
as much our attribute, as the odor is the attribute of the rose,
and, like the rose, we diffuse it wherever we move; so that
whosoever seeth us, smelleth us, or toucheth us, draweth virtue
from us, and is made free. [Tempests, whirlwinds, cyclones of
applause that nearly lift Pharaoh Phrique off his feet.]</p>

<p>“Thus it is, brethren, that in all this broad land there is no
such thing as a slave, never was, and never can be. A slave, or
an oppressed dog of any description here, is an anomaly we
would not endure for a moment. [Much applause from the
fleas and joy amongst the dogs.]</p>

<p>“The great reason why this is the cradle and home of Liberty
is, that every true, native born Canisvillian&mdash;be he dog or be he
flea&mdash;burns so brightly with the sacred fire of Liberty, that he
acts as though he were the sole and only defender of his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span>

country’s rights and liberties. Here each citizen springs spontaneously
to its defense. Not a flea of us but would spring with
alacrity, at the first call of danger, to lend the Government, at
six per cent., and good security, all the wealth he has; and I am
sure that the noble patriotism of our citizen dogs is such that
not a dog would shirk to go forth to fight and die for his Country
and Flag. [Rampageous cheering by the dogs, marred by a
voice, “At naught per cent. and no security.”]</p>

<p>“Oh! Brethren!” exclaimed Brother Phrique, ignoring the interruption,
that made the Bamboozling Committee look uneasily
at each other, “if there is one thing more than another that
this Flag&mdash;my Flag, your Flag&mdash;has wrought into the very fibre
of my soul, it is the love of Liberty, Justice and Fair Dealing.
Oh, how my soul burns with indignation when I read of the
injustice and brutal tyranny that are practised on the poor dogs
in foreign lands&mdash;oppressions that our free and noble dogs would
not endure for a moment! Oh! I wonder they do not rise and
kill their oppressors. But they do the next best thing. They
have heard that over here is the only genuine and original Flag
of Liberty; and they come by hundreds and by thousands&mdash;escaped
slaves&mdash;to rest them under its shadow, and dwell in
peace and plenty forever more, where the oppressor ceases from
troubling, and the weary are at rest.” [A voice from afar off:
“How about your Blood and Bones Grindery, and your Devil’s
Cheap Bargain Counter Dogs?” Great confusion, and a rush
of police dogs to that part, with no result.]</p>

<p>Here the Bamboozling Committee cast anxious glances at
each other, and hastily got together in a rear corner, and
Brother Grandadhat said to Mountebank Dephool Flea, “Oh,
Chancy, Brother Phrique will wreck this whole Bamboozle.
What Evil Spirit from the Lord led that dog to ask him that
unfortunate question? Oh! that we had not allowed him to
come forward!”</p>

<p>And Chancy replied, “It is unfortunate, very. We must shut
him off, somehow, or he will certainly render all our Bamboozle

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span>

nugatory. There are evidently some of those thinking dogs
present, damn ’em. If it had not been for them, this hocus-pocus
would have gone off swimmingly.”</p>

<p>“Thinking dogs present, did you say, Brother Chancy?”
exclaimed Carnivorous, shaking with fright. “Do you think
there is danger of more trouble? Hadn’t I better get away
over the pond? Is there any boat ready? Am I likely to get
hurt? I have a Reputation to maintain. My Mission and the
Voice of Duty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Andy,” broke in Wilhelm Bunkum Mak
Tinley, “this Bamboozle is no failure by a long chalk. We will
get Brother Phrique out of the way. It was a great folly and
oversight on our part to let him be put forward at this juncture.
But I will tickle these dogs’ ears, and pull wool over their eyes,
and more than make up for this misadventure.”</p>

<p>“Canst thou save us, Brother Mak Tinley?” said Andronicus.</p>

<p>“You bet I can,” replied Mak Tinley. “Why, these Canisville
dogs are the most gullible fools in all creation. They are
a fish that can be caught with a bare hook every time, if only
one has courage and address enough to know how to fling it.
The secret lies in lying to them with the most tremendous sincerity
and boldness. It is the triumph of mind over matter; of
intellect over brute strength.”</p>

<p>“Then we will get Brother Phrique off and put thee on,”
said President Dephool Flea.</p>

<p>So Chancy Mountebank whispered softly for a few moments
unto Pharaoh Phrique, and advised him to slow down his
speech, and taper off and wind up and retire as gracefully as he
could, as he was jeopardizing the Bamboozle.</p>

<p>And Pharaoh took the hint, and perorated a few minutes
about the beauty of brotherly love, of righteousness, Liberty,
patriotism and the Flag; and having made exactly one dozen
obeisances to the glorious Flag of the Free, and spent five
minutes in silent and rapturous adoration of it, he slid away to
the rear, and sank out of sight, and was no more seen or heard.</p>

<p>THEN arose Wilhelm Bunkum Mak Tinley Flea and stepped forward,
while all the assembled fleas cheered and applauded to the echo, which
made all the dogs think that he must be some extraordinary prophet,
either just arisen or just come down. He was a portly flea, of most
benevolent aspect, and seemed to be the very embodiment of sincerity.
He had a mild and beautiful God-Bless-You-My-Children eye, and a
beautifully sympathetic O-How-I-Love-You mouth, which at once inspired
respect. And when he opened his mouth to speak, his softly

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>

cadent voice floated o’er the vast assembly of dogs like angelic music,
so that they&mdash;utter strangers to such delightful sounds&mdash;stood
entranced, and the Bamboozling Committee beamed glances of perfect
satisfaction on one another.</p>

<p>“Incline your ears unto me, O beautiful, dutiful dogs,” said
he, “dogs of a goodly lineage, free born, noble and independent.
Give ear unto my voice. I esteem it the proudest honor of
my life to be permitted the precious privilege of standing before
and addressing such a vast audience of free and intellectual
dogs, as the one now before me. [Great straightening up of
the dogs, and brightening of their eyes.] This is an audience
whose intelligent eyes and noble brows show at once that nothing
but TRUTH will go down with them, [Greater straightening
up of the dogs.] that to fool them is an impossible task.
And why? Because ye are Canisvillians, and that [pointing] is
your Flag, the Flag of the Free. [Great cheering from the fleas
and dogs too.]</p>

<p>“And not only is that the Flag of Freedom, but it is the Flag
of Prosperity, too. [Fleas cheer, while dogs wonder.] Yes,
fellow citizens, I repeat it, the Flag of Prosperity. Never was
there a country so free or so prosperous; and I may say never
was there a country so able to defend its freedom and prosperity.
[Cheering.]</p>

<p>“I regret to say that there are certain unpatriotic dogs
amongst us, who are so far lost to the sense of their duty to
stick up for their country, right or wrong, as to wickedly assert
that dogs in this country are hungry and poor; but we fling the
calumny in their teeth; we brand it as a lie; we rejoin that it
is the lie of our country’s old time enemy, Kyhidom, and for
you dogs to believe it, were a libel upon your intelligence.
[Great wonderment on the countenances of the dogs.]</p>

<p>“But, fellow free citizens, they cannot fool you thus; ye know
that ye are neither hungry nor poor.</p>

<p>“What do Statistics tell us? What saith Average? What
saith Protection? What saith the Great Hunkidori? What

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span>

saith the Gospel of the Balance of Trade? What saith the Book
of the Prophecy of the Exports and Imports? What is the
voice of the ever blessed and adorable Gold Basis? All these
Holy Scriptures teach us that there is neither hunger nor poverty
in all this glorious land under the Flag of the Free; that
we, as a country, are the fairest, fattest and wealthiest people
God’s sun ever shone on. [Tempestuous applause from the
fleas, and great mesmerism of the dogs, some, however, absent-mindedly
stroking their flat bellies.]</p>

<p>“Fellow citizens, the Gospel of the Balance of Trade telleth
us that the Balance is with us, and not agin us. Our god Protection,
is as a wall of fire round about us, warming and comforting
us within, and scorching and shrivelling all those without.
The Book of the Prophecy of the Exports and Imports
assureth us that our bread is certain and our water sure. The
Great Hunkidori speaketh and saith that <i>we</i> are all right, and
there is nothing the matter with <i>us</i>. And we have the precious
promise of the ever blessed and adorable Gold Basis that no
evil shall touch us while ever our feet are planted on its eternal
foundation. And Statistics tell us that Our National Wealth
is greater than that of any nation of dogs under heaven.
[Lusty cheers from the fleas, and delighted expressions on the
faces of the dogs.]</p>

<p>“Yes, fellow citizens, Statistics never lie. They are our infallible
guide through the wilderness of assertion and counter-assertion.
You may rest your weary feet on them every time.
When heart and flesh fail you, and despondency taketh hold
upon you; when ye walk through the valley of ghosts and
spectres of Hunger and Poverty and Want, and ye are sore
afraid they are upon you, then look ye to, and trust ye in Statistics,
and ye shall be saved; the ghosts and spectres shall fly
away and ye shall know that ye are full and happy. [Sobs and
cries of joy from the dogs at this beautiful Free Salvation.]</p>

<p>“See, Brethren, See! Statistics tell us that the dogs of Canisville
and country are 65,000. Statistics also tell us that our

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span>

National Wealth Heaps, in charge of the Sacred Trustees, contain
more than equal to 650,000 basketfuls of good, wholesome
food, which, divided by 65,000, gives an Average of <i>ten basketfuls
Per Capita</i>. [Ejaculations of surprise and astonishment
from the dogs, who had no idea before that they were so
wealthy.]</p>

<p>“Now, fellow citizens, this is a wonderful showing. Only
think of it! <i>Ten basketfuls to every dog in Canisville!</i>
Enough to make every dog quite corpulent and his ribs to bulge
with fullness. It is marvellous. It is astounding. No other
dogs in the whole wide world can show such an Average. I am
told by our brother, Chancy Mountebank Dephool Flea, and
by brother Andronicus Carnivorous, that over the pond, in the
best countries there, the Average is not more than <i>one basketful
per capita</i>; that in most it is less than that, and that in some it is
nothing at all. [Sighs of sympathy from the dogs for those
poor devils.]</p>

<p>“Should not our dogs then, instead of repining that they are
not more wealthy, rejoice and be exceeding glad that they are
so much better off than the poor oppressed dogs of other lands?
Ought they not to thank God hourly for their great Average, and
to bless him for Statistics that make such a wonderful Average
possible?</p>

<p>“TEN BASKETFULS PER CAPITA!!! Think for a moment
what that means. Statistics tell us that the average of mouthfuls
to the basket, is, in round numbers, one hundred. This,
multiplied by ten, equals <i>one thousand mouthfuls per dog</i>.
Think of it! <i>One thousand mouthfuls of</i> GOOD VICTUALS
<i>per dog.</i> [Sensation amongst the dogs; great watering of
mouths and licking of chops.] The mind fails to grasp the immensity
of the fact; it is stunned; it staggers; it reels. Imagination’s
utmost stretch in wonder dies away. It is wealth
incomprehensible. ONE THOUSAND MOUTHFULS PER
DOG!!! It sounds like Fiction. It sounds like a lie, it is so
incredible; and yet, there are the Statistics; there are the figures

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>

which are beyond disproof, beyond dispute. [Great cheering
by the dogs over these facts.]</p>

<p>“Well may the true Canisville dog be proud of his country
and his Flag; proud of his comfortable home and his sleek and
fat condition; proud of the Statistics, and proud of the generous
Average the Statistics give him to eat. [The dogs applaud and
cry, “Three cheers for Mak Tinley.”]</p>

<p>“Shall we surrender, then, this our prosperity, to our Enemy?
[Never, from the dogs.] Shall we haul down the Flag of
Freedom that gives us this prosperity? [No, no, no, from the
dogs, and Perish the thought, from the fleas.] Patriots, fellow
citizens, brothers, let us ever cherish, down in our deepest
hearts, the principles that have, under God, differentiated us
from the rest of the world and lifted us to the highest pinnacle
of wealth and greatness that dogs ever enjoyed. Let us never
surrender them, but stick by the Holy Statistics and the Average;
by our Protection and the Great Hunkidori; by the Gospel
of the Balance of Trade, the Book of the Prophecy of the
Exports and Imports, and the ever blessed and adorable Gold
Basis. Abide by these; fight for them; if needs be, die for
them; thus shall ye enjoy life and wealth, and glory and
honor and blessing yourselves, and hand down intact
your glorious heritage to your happy posterity.”</p>

<p>Making genuflexion to the flag, and bowing to the
dogs, Mak Tinley retired, while storms
of applause broke out from the dogs.</p>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>WILHELM Bunkum Mak Tinley’s oration made a profound impression. Upon
assembled fleas there fell a peace as of an undisturbed sea, a sweet
consciousness that at last, all danger from dog-thinking was safely
over. The Bamboozling Committee beamed and winked at each other in
silent ecstasy. And as for the dogs, nothing like their satisfaction
ever was before seen. Mak Tinley’s magnificent effort had done the job.
There was in it an array of facts and figures that carried conviction
home to their hearts and consciences. Poetry, imagery and gush the
others had given&mdash;which was all very delightful&mdash;but he had

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>

risen to the needs of the times. They were hungry and wasted, and he
had opened the granary of his brilliant imagination, and had poured out
upon them some real, genuine, solid, substantial, and stomach filling
Statistics and Averages, that put new life and soul into them. They
danced and howled with joy; they hugged and kissed each other, and
blessed God for Mak Tinley, the Stomach Filler. One meagre and unkempt
dog cried, “Three cheers for Mak Tinley, Statistics and Averages,” which
all the dogs gave. Then another meagre dog yelled, “Hurrah for our
Country and Flag, the finest in the world,” and all the dogs hurrahed,
the pretty cloths were fluttered on high, the loud-noise-producing
instruments were blown and banged and thumped, and at the word “Flag,”
all the fleas arose and made prosternation.</p>

<p>Then a large, thin and lanky dog, with hungry eyes, jumped
up and demanded that three cheers be rendered unto the Bamboozling
Committee; which were no sooner given than he
inquired with great and strident solicitude, “What is the matter
with Harry Grandadhat?” And the whole assembly of dogs
and fleas, before Grandadhat had time to reply on his own behalf,
thundered out in one mighty chorus, “He’s all right;”
to which some one, who had evidently not heard who was
referred to, inquired, “Who’s all right?” to which again the
whole assembly, very courteously and obligingly, responded in
chorus: “Why, Harry Grandadhat.” All which catechism
seemed, for some deep and inscrutable reason, to cause a perfect
delirium of joy. And the delirium spread and waxed until
nothing was heard or seen but the chorused catechism, three
cheers for everything and everybody, the hubbub of the wind
and thump instruments, the waving of the pretty cloths, and
the dogs tearing madly around, howling, standing on their
heads, rolling on the ground, and leaping over each other for
joy and gladness.</p>

<p>At last the tempest lulled, and the Blatherskite stepped forward
and said, “Brethren, now is the accepted time; now is

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>

the day of testimony. In this hour of softened splendor and
outpouring upon us all of the holy spirit of patriotism, if there
is any dog here that feels it borne in upon his soul to testify,
let him step up, and the Lord be with him.”</p>

<p>Then stepped up the large and lanky dog of the hungry eyes,
lolling out his tongue and panting with his recent great exertions,
and feebly tottered up the eminence to testify. But before
he commenced, Chancy Mountebank Dephool Flea got
hold of him, and demanded of him his name, that he might
introduce him. Then Dephool Flea stepped forward and said,
“Dogs and fellow citizens: This respected citizen says his
name is Honest Labor, and that he desires to say what the Flag
has done for his soul. Oh, fellow citizens, I need not tell you
that such as he are the pride and strength of our common
country, that it is to him and the Lowly Toiler, that the grandeur,
magnificence and superbity of our material prosperity are
due. Let us all gratefully remember that without him and his
unceasing toil, this country had not been; that to him are we
beholden for a large part&mdash;if not the largest part&mdash;of our wealth;
that our brain, without his diligent paw, would have been absolutely
useless; that in the upbuilding of this great country, he
was the greatest factor, and that to him we look for its defence,
its perpetuity.</p>

<p>“And I may say that it is our pride that this is <i>a</i> country,
this is THE country, this the ONLY country in the world,
where Honest Labor is held in honor; yea, in reverence; yea,
that is crowned with glory and honor, and given first place in
our esteem, and&mdash;&mdash;” Here a loud voice came from afar off in
the crowd, “First place at the grub basket would suit him
better,” followed by great confusion, alarm, and a great rush of
police dogs that way, and a sound of thumped heads. The fleas
looked anxious, and the Bamboozlers uneasy, and Andronicus
Carnivorous, scenting danger, sidled off. Dephool Flea was
much discumfuzzled, and nearly lost his cherubic smile; but
he heroically held up his end, and continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“As I was saying, other effete countries have their kings and
lords; but here we recognize no king, but Honest Labor [great
cheers and restoration of confidence], no order of nobility but
that of Humble Toil; and in no country does Honest Labor get
so large a share of his own product, or hold his head so high
with the conscious pride of his own worth. I have the proud
honor and precious privilege of introducing him.”</p>

<p>During all this speech, it was noticed that poor Honest Labor
was changing visibly. At first his hungry eye grew bright, and
his nostrils distended; and as the eloquence waxed in tumidity
and turgidity, his head was lifted up and began to swell and
swell, and at the crowning reference to his coronation as a king,
it took a sudden and mighty inflation that made his body and
legs look ridiculously thin and small and spindling by comparison.</p>

<p>“What thinkest thou of our Chancy now?” said Harry
Grandadhat, to his dear friend, the Holy One a Maker of long
prayers, as he pointed to the Phenomenon.</p>

<p>“Called and chosen, called and chosen,” replied One a Maker
of prayers, “God hath indeed given unto him great talents.”</p>

<p>“The Bamboozle prospereth indeed,” said Mak Tinley, and
tipping the wink to the Monstrous Fleas, he whispered to one
of the nearest of them, whose name was Shikago Pigsfoot,
“Brother, merrily will go the Blood and Bones Mill after this.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” replied Shikago Pigsfoot, “the last drop of
blood shall be squeezed out of them. I am famishing to see the
Mill going again, it seems an awful loss to waste a whole day
when every tiny drop of blood is so precious to us; but I
suppose this bamboozle is all for our ultimate good. Oh, that
to-morrow were here and the Mill going!”</p>

<p>Then stepped forward Honest Labor, and having made obeisance
to the Flag, as he had seen the flea speakers do, he spake:</p>

<p>“Feller dogs; this is the proudest moment of my life.
Feller dogs, you mustn’t expect a fine speech from me, for as I
was born poor and hungry, I had to turn out at eight months

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span>

old to scratch for bones to eke out the family living. Consequently,
I haint had no eddication. My father, whose name was
Lowly Toil, and is dead now, having been taken off early by
a mysterious epidemic called ‘Vacuity of the Alimentary
Canal,’ that was going about at that time, was always too poor
to give me any eddication; but, bless the Lord, he gave me
what is far better&mdash;he early planted in my youthful breast the
love of country. Says he to me, says he, he says, ‘Honny,
this ’ere’s your Country and that there’s your Flag, and you’ll
never get such another Country with such another Flag on it,
if you sarch the earth over. It’s the finest Country and the
finest Flag that ever was or ever will be, and don’t you forget it.’
[Burst of applause from the fleas and dogs too.] Says I to him,
says I, I says, ‘Father, I never will; come dark, come light,
come weal, come woe, come anything, I’ll never go back on my
Country and my Flag.’ [Tempest of cheers.]</p>

<p>“And I never have. This is God’s country. [Cheers from
the fleas.] It is a free country. [Cheers.] It is the poor dog’s
country. [Cheers on cheers from the fleas and dogs too.]
Everybody says so. The foreign dogs from over the pond say
so. Where will you find a country that gives the honest worker
so good a living? [Immense cheering by the fleas.] Where
will you find a country that gives such ‘constant employment?’
And pays such ‘high wages?’ [Cheers from the fleas, and
“Aye, that’s the question,” from the Bamboozlers.] Where so
many dogs have snug bank accounts? Where Statistics give
dogs such a high Average of victuals to eat? [Immense cheers
and cries of “Hurrah for Mak Tinley.”] Where there is such
a wide ‘diffusion of comfort and content?’ [Cheers, and
“Hurrah for Grandadhat.”] Where will you find a country
as gives such chances for poor and honest dogs to get on and
come to the Great Transformation? [Great cheers.]</p>

<p>“Look at Carnivorous; he was poor and honest once, and
<i>now</i> look at him. And he aint the only one. Look at our
<i>Gold Jays</i>, our <i>Rollefeckers</i>, our <i>Armorses</i>, our <i>Makkizes</i>, our

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>

<i>Bandervilts</i>, our <i>Pimples</i>, our <i>Carbuncles</i>, our <i>Corns</i>, our <i>Warts</i>,
our <i>Bunions</i>; all poor and honest once, and now see what they
are. I tell you, feller dogs, there never was a Country and a
Flag as gave the poor and honest such grand chances to get on
and become something totally different. Look at our Blood
and Bones Grindery! Why, I am told that if any of our free
and happy Handle turners were to go over the pond, and get a
job in them foreign pauper labor grinderies, they would be disgusted
with the long hours and small pay. There the Monstrous
Fleas actually demand that every dog give a whole leg to
the hopper, before he can get a place at the Handle, and is,
moreover, bound to serve seven years before he can leave his
job. But here, in this free country, a dog has only got to contribute
two or three toes, and is free to leave his job whenever
he chooses. [Wonderful cheering.]</p>

AND  BANDERVILTS." width="600" height="384" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>“Everything in this glorious country is away ahead of the
old countries. Even the rags of the dogs here look more
respectable than there; and as for poverty, such a thing is not
known here, for if a dog have neither food, nor kennel, nor
where to lay his head, he can look up and thank God that he
has a Country and a Flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“I grind at the Handle nineteen hours a day, and I have
given four toes to the hopper; but I thank God that I might be
far worse off. Often I am hungry, very hungry, but I thank
God that I might be hungrier. I am contented. It is the duty
of dogs to be contented [applause from the Monstrous Fleas,]
a dog that is always growling about his lot, is a nuisance to
himself and everybody else. God don’t love him, the Church
don’t respect him, and his employers hate him.”</p>

<p>Here all the Bamboozlers arose and patted him on the back,
and the Blatherskite turned to the assembly and said, “Behold,
a model citizen. Blessed are the contented, for when they die
the gates of Heaven shall swing wide open to let them in.”</p>

<p>Continuing, Honest Labor said, “It is the duty of every dog
to stick up for the country that gives him employment and
keeps wages as high as they are. The only thing we have to
fear, is that them foreign pauper dogs from over the pond,
envious of our great prosperity, will come crowding over here,
and tempt our employers to cut down our wages. But I am
convinced that all our eminent, wealthy and Monstrous Fleas,
led on and sustained by such friends of ours as Carnivorous,
Phrique, Mak Tinley, Dephool Flea, Webbfoot, and others,
would make a tremendous fight against that temptation before
they would yield. Therefore, I say, three times three cheers
for our Country, our Institutions, and our Flag, the freest,
finest and grandest in the world.”</p>

<p>The burst of applause that followed this simple eloquence was
deafening. The wind and bang instruments struck up, the
dogs ranted and raved, the Bamboozling Committee stood on
their heads with delight and all the fleas beamed with silent
ecstasy.</p>

<p>A wonderful thing now happened. Exactly
how it happened was a secret known only to the
Bamboozling Committee and some of their intimates;
but just as the delirium of the dogs’ joy
was at its height, the whole assembly of the fleas
arose as by one simultaneous impulse and cried:
“Long live Honest Labor, son of Lowly Toil! He shall be our
King. Bring forth the Royal Diadem and crown him Lord of
all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>And suddenly, beneath the great Flag of the Free, a great
and gorgeous throne was set; and the Bamboozling Committee,
gathering around and making genuflexion to poor Honest Labor&mdash;whose
head by this time had grown to an enormous size&mdash;led
him with every sign of homage and adoration, and amid the delighted
admiration of the dogs, to the throne, and set him
therein. And when he was set, a lot of the wealthy, eminent
and Monstrous Fleas, headed by Grandadhat and Dephool Flea,
ranged themselves up as a bodyguard of worshippers on either
side of him; and another lot, headed by Bunkum Mak Tinley,
fell at his feet as Homage Renderers. And Grandadhat, making
a sign to the vast multitude of dogs, ostentatiously kissed him
on the nose and on the right ear; and Dephool Flea, making
another sign to the multitude, ostentatiously kissed him on the
nose and on the left ear; and Mak Tinley, on behalf of the
Homage Renderers generally, and on his own behalf particularly,
kissed him on the feet; and all three, turning dramatically
to the dogs, cried: “Behold our King!”</p>

<p>And all the assembled fleas cried out in chorus: “God save
the King!”</p>

<p>Then cried aloud Dephool Flea: “The Royal Diadem, the
Royal Diadem! Bring it forth, and crown him Lord of all.”</p>

<p>Then there stepped forth a very large flea, Grover Ponderous
Flea by name, bearing a gorgeous looking regalia&mdash;a robe, a
sceptre and a crown of very large diameter&mdash;followed by two
small satellite fleas, named, the one Rosy Pretty Flower, the
other Pennzy Pattyson, bearing between them a ponderous
bowl filled to the brim with some golden liquid, around which
flies buzzed. Whereupon all the dogs gave a great howl of delight,
for they seemed to know them.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” they cried, “for Grover Ponderous Flea, the new
Nighunto; the tried and trusty friend and worshipper of Honest
Labor. Hurrah! Hurrah!! Hurrah!!!”</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_189.jpg" alt="Illustration: THEN THERE STEPPED FORTH A VERY LARGE FLEA, GROVER PONDEROUS FLEA BY NAME." width="600" height="391" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>And Grover Ponderous Flea, bowing graciously to the
dogs, and smiling knowingly to the fleas, advanced to the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span>

throne, and lifting up his eyes to the Flag, thus addressed the
occupant:</p>

<p>“Oh Honest Labor, whose very name is hallowed, hail! All
hail! In this Land of the Free, whose very air is instantaneously
deadly poison to tyranny and kings of the ancient sort, we,
God’s own free-born, have learned that there is nothing truly
noble but that which Nature has patented; that nothing deserves
to reign but that which Nature has crowned King. Our fathers,
the prophets, who gave us our Liberty and our Flag, taught us,
and we, their children, have learned that <i>Honest Labor is the
Creator of all Wealth</i>, our guide, preserver and friend, the Prop
of our Republic, without whose support the bottom would fall
out, and therefore the only true, rightful, Nature-ordained king,
the only right sort of a king to reign over US, the finest race of
dogs and fleas that God in his wonderful wisdom ever created.</p>

<p>“Therefore, in the name of all these dogs assembled here,
and all the fleas, whose loyalty I voice, I invest thy sacred and
large head, oh, Honest Labor, with this crown of large diameter.
Thou art our Lord; thou art our King. We worship thee. We
love thy dirty paws. We love thy smell. We proudly point to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 190]</span>

thine ungroomed and unwashen hide, for they are the insignia
of thine inherent glory. Henceforth thou art our Lord, our
god and King, and we thine ever-obedient subjects.” And
with that he put the robe upon him, and put the sceptre in his
right paw, and retired backward from the Royal Presence.</p>

<p>Then cried Dephool Flea again: “Bring forth the Royal
Taffy Bowl and feed him royally full.”</p>

<p>Then did Grover Ponderous Flea advance again, this time
preceded by his satellites, Rosy Pretty Flower and Pennzy Pattyson,
bearing the ponderous bowl. He gave a sign, and all the
Bamboozling Committee and a large number of fleas of all sorts,
High Pressurists, Low Pressurists, Nighuntos and Faraways,
smiling and smirking in most heavenly amicability upon one
another, gathered around the Taffy Bowl.</p>

<p>Then Grover Ponderous Flea called upon Tee de Little Wit
Blatherskite to say grace over the mess&mdash;which he did in his
most blatherskitish and perfervid manner&mdash;and then lifting up
his eyes to heaven, he muttered over it some words of a strange
lingo, which none but the most learned of the Bamboozling
Committee understood. Some said he was enraptured, and was
in a trance, and was conversing with spirits who spoke a dialect
of that part of heaven called Sherrycoblerland, which he understood.
Some said it was not so; he was praying, which
nobody there at all understood. But some very knowing fleas
said Grover Ponderous Flea was a Great High Priest and had
the gift of Transubstantiation, and was really muttering the
Sacred Words over the Taffy, which transformed it into the
real body and blood of the Everblessed Truth and Verity. Be it
as it may, these were the words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There is one important aspect of the subject which especially
should never be overlooked, at times like the present;
when the evils of unsound finance threaten us, the speculator
may anticipate a harvest gathered from the misfortune of others,
the capitalist may protect himself by hoarding, or may
even find profit in the fluctuation of values, but the wage
earner&mdash;the first to be injured by a depreciated currency, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>

the last to receive the benefit of its correction&mdash;is practically
defenceless. He relies for work upon the ventures of confident
and contented capital; this failing him, his condition is without
alleviation, for he can neither prey on the misfortunes of
others, nor hoard his labor. One of the greatest statesmen our
country has known, speaking more than fifty years ago, when
a derangement of the currency had caused commercial distress,
said: ‘The very man of all others who has the deepest interest
in a sound currency and who suffers most by mischievous legislation
in money matters, is the man who earns his daily bread
by his daily toil.’ These words are as pertinent now as the day
they were uttered, and ought to impressively remind us that a
failure of the discharge of our duties at this time must especially
injure those of our countrymen who labor, and who,
because of their number and condition, are entitled to the most
watchful care of their government.”</p></blockquote>

<p>These words ended, all the fleas feeling sure that such
beautiful words called for an Amen anyhow, said “Amen,”
and then the Taffy Ladlers, led by Grover Ponderous Flea,
Taffyist-in-Chief, passed reverently before King Honest Labor,
and crying, “Oh, King, live forever,” poured each a spoonful
down his throat, and poor Honest Labor, astonished at the
unfamiliar tickling of something to swallow, eagerly opened
his mouth its widest and hungriest.</p>

<p>It was noticed that the Taffy Ladlers, as they passed by and
fed the King, shuddered with a disgust they tried laboriously to
conceal. Some muttered to each other, “Confound this job; but
it has to be done.” One said, “I don’t like his smell.”
“Neither do I, but we must pretend we do,” replied another.
Rosy Pretty Flower turned to his fellow satellite and asked:
“Brother, why do we have to worship and taffy this dirty, lousy
dog?” “Well, brother,” replied Pennzy Pattyson, “it is not
given common mortals to solve the heavenly mysteries; all we
know is, that the Bamboozling Committee, in their inscrutable
wisdom, have decreed that we must. For my own private
part, I’d rather shoot him.” “So would I,” briskly rejoined
Rosy Pretty Flower, “but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>His words were drowned, for the Taffy Ladlers, having finished
their function, the whole multitude of the fleas broke out
in a grand Ascription that rent the heavens with loudness, as
prostrating themselves, they sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“All hail! Oh, Honest Labor, hail!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At thy dear feet we fall;</div>

<p>And the noise of the Ascription was heard afar off; insomuch
that Andronicus Carnivorous, who, thinking he scented danger,
had sidled off and was by this time some miles away, stopped
and inquired what the noise might be, and whether it signified
the outbreak of trouble. To which one made answer that there
was a great Apotheosis on, and all the fleas were deifying Honest
Labor, a well known but terribly scrawny and hungry dog
that was almighty popular with the fleas on Bamboozle Day.</p>

<p>“God forgive me!” cried Andronicus, penitently, “that I
should be derelict in duty on this auspicious occasion. Why,
Honest Labor is my dearest love, to whom I owe my wealth,
my life, my all. Oh, I would not be absent from his coronation
for all the world.” And he hopped back as hard as he could hop.</p>

<p>And Mak Tinley, seeing him returned, said unto him:
“Whence comest thou, Andronicus? We had chosen thee to
officiate as Grand High Priest, to place the crown on Honest
Labor’s head, but thou wert missing when wanted, and we
were forced to give the job to brother Ponderous Flea, who, I
must say, has acquitted himself in the sacred office most brilliantly,
and as well as the best Bamboozler of us all could have
done.”</p>

<p>“Alack and alas! Brother Mak Tinley,” replied Andronicus,
“thou knowest that I am a somewhat timid flea; and I thought,
when brother Pharaoh Phrique was speaking that there was
going to be trouble; so I sidled off. I see now that my fears
were unfounded. I am awfully sorry to have missed this coronation,
but I’ll try to be on hand at the next crowning and
taffying.”</p>

<p>And when the multitude of the dogs saw the multitude of the
fleas fall prostrate to Honest Labor, and heard the shout of the
great Ascription, they were astounded and delighted; and they
said to one another that surely the fleas were their dearest
friends; that surely they could have no wealth comparable to a
Country and a Flag, and that surely in a land where Statistics
and great Averages abounded on all sides, and where great
crops of them could be reaped at any time, and where Honest
Labor was held in such reverence as to be crowned King, it was
sinful, it was positively wicked&mdash;to imagine for a moment that
they were hungry, that Hunger was a Delusion and Unpatriotism,
that every truly loyal Canisvillian was bound in duty to
the Flag to deny the existence of and repudiate.</p>

<p>And their delirious joy did make them deaf to the rumblings
of their empty bellies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>And all the multitude of the fleas arose, and, led by the Bamboozling
Committee, formed and marched in Solemn Procession
around and around King Honest Labor&mdash;whose head by
this time was grown so big that it threatened to burst its crown.</p>

<p>Oh, they were a goodly crowd of infinitely varied hues and
colors, and antagonistic opinions of each other, all blended together
that day in one grand harmony of purpose and feeling.
Low Pressurists, Medium Pressurists, High Pressurists, Nighuntos,
Faraways, Petty Squabblers, Grand Squabblers, Eminent
Fleas, Wealthy Fleas, Monstrous Fleas, all were Dog
Worshippers then, and the most humble and obedient servants
and subjects of His Grievously Hungry but Supernal Majesty,
King Honest Labor; and as they marched past him each swung
a censer of thickly fuming and heavily perfumed Flattery under
his royal nose; and as they marched and swung, they sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“In politics always</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At loggerheads we;</div>
    <div class="verse">But we’re all of us one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In our worship of thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">Honest Labor.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And they shouted “God save the King!” and all the dogs to
the waving of the pretty cloths and a crash of the wind, bang
and thump instruments, cried “Amen.” And they swung the
censers, and cried “Long Live the King!” and all the dogs
answered “Amen,” and they prostrated themselves and cried,
“All hail the King;” and all the dogs cried, “All hail!”</p>

<p>And right in the midst of the grand insanity the heavens were
again darkened; the weird green and yellow lights flashed
again; the heavenly breeze lifted up the proud and noble Flag,
and flapped it with a great flapping; the fleas prostrated themselves
again, and the dogs followed suit. The Bamboozling
Committee, with Grover Ponderous Flea and his satellites,
gathered around the throne and the Flag in a sacred circle, and
the Reverend Salaried Barker Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite
stepped forth, and turning to the dogs with outstretched paw,
lifted up a voice of solemnity and cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“Hear ye, O dogs, O hear ye. Thus saith Heaven: This is
the Flag of the Free, and this is the throne of King Honest
Labor, our National Pride and Glory, the only real, genuine,
and original Flag and throne; designed in Heaven and set up
in the only spot on earth worth living in&mdash;Canisville&mdash;where
God hath concentrated his blessings; the Flag, at the terror of
whose shake slavery, ill-government, corruption, injustice, inequality
run shrieking and terrified to hell; under whose blessed
protection, virtue, honesty and industry always come to honor
and wealth; and vice, idleness and dishonesty to want, shame
and everlasting contempt [Solemn snickering and winking
amongst the Bamboozling Committee; and the Holy One a
Maker of long prayers, is heard to gently murmur, “True, all
true; bless the Lord!”] a Flag under which all fleas are prosperous
and all dogs are contented, and all things go on in
divinely appointed order.</p>

<p>“Now therefore, seeing we have the grandest Country on
earth, the grandest Throne, the grandest King, and the grandest
Flag floating over us all, let us take these grand dispensations
as Heaven’s bow of promise that God will evermore bless
us and keep us. Where these are, no evil can touch us; no
hunger, no poverty can ever come.</p>

<p>“Therefore, in the name of Heaven, whose secrets I am on
familiar terms with, and to whom particularly God has revealed
his will, I say poverty, hunger, want, begone! and to fullness,
plenty and content, come and abide! Begone panic! begone
lack of confidence! begone crisis! Let there be a conspiracy of
cheerful sermons and words and talk. Let all dogs stop singing
‘Windham’ and sing ‘Coronation.’ Let them positively refuse
to admit the existence of hunger amongst them. Conspire
together to believe yourselves round and plump and fat and full.
It is all a matter of confidence and faith; for the Blessed Book
on the costly cushion, which it hath been given to me alone of
Heaven to interpret, saith: “All things are possible unto
them that believe!” Therefore have faith, and be ye full, contented

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 196]</span>

and happy; and know ye that this is the grandest
country in the world, and this the grandest moment of the
grandest hour of the grandest year of the grandest century the
world ever saw.”</p>

<p>Then the Blatherskite, lifting his eyes and paws to heaven,
invoked upon them all an abundance of corn and wine and oil
and bones and meat, and on top of them Heaven’s choicest
spiritual blessings; all the Bamboozlers said “Amen,” the sun
came out in dazzling splendor; the Flag fluttered once more; the
pretty cloths were waved; the wind, bang and thump instruments
made a final hubbub, and the great Bamboozle came to an end,
and the delighted and happy dogs, with a final cheer, dispersed.</p>

<p>Then the Bamboozlers laughed and winked to each other, and
hauled down the Flag of the Free and packed it away until
wanted again.</p>

<p>But when they went to pull down the throne, they noticed
that poor King Honest Labor was fallen over to one side, and
when they went to tear his crown and robe off, they lifted him
up, and with surprise noticed that he was stone dead and cold.</p>

<p>And one ran and fetched one of the curious creatures called
“Emdees,” who looked the poor dog over, and gave it as his
opinion that deceased had come by his decease by reason of
heart failure, superinduced by the great excitement of the great
Function, to which his constitution, etcetera, was inadequate,
owing to chronic Vacuity of the Alimentary Canal, which was,
no doubt, according to a previous statement of the deceased, an
hereditary complaint, for which no one but deceased’s parents
were to blame; and it was his opinion that parents ought not to
have such complaints.</p>

<p>And some of the Bamboozlers said it was unfortunate that he
should have died just then, as the pesky thinking dogs might
hear of it, and do something to wreck the Bamboozle. But
others confidently asserted that all dogs were fools anyhow, and
that if they did get to hear that Honest Labor had died of starvation,
they would forget all about it by next Bamboozle Day.</p>

<p>IT was many days before the force of the Great Bamboozle spent
itself. Though the scramble and scratching for bones was even fiercer
than ever; and though the infernal grind at the Handle of the Blood Mill
grew daily more hellish, and the cruel greed of the bloated Monstrous
Fleas grew daily more adamantine and pitiless; though robbery, murder,
death by starvation and suicide grew daily more common, the dogs had
been so thoroughly hypnotized that they perversely sought everywhere for
a cause for all these things save in the right place.</p>

<p>They had graduated so well in the course of patriotism they
had recently been put through that in their midnight meetings
together, to bark and talk over their distressful condition, they

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 198]</span>

put up a fac-simile of the great Flag of Canisville and ordered
that every meeting be opened by genuflexion to the Flag of
Freedom and Prosperity, and closed by prostration to the Flag
of Liberty and Plethoric Stomach; and further ordered that all
speeches, arguments and discussions should proceed upon certain
indubitable and undiscussible premises called Sacred
Truths. They were:</p>

<p>(1.) This is a Free Country.</p>

<p>(2.) Our Flag is the Flag of Liberty.</p>

<p>(3.) All Good is indigenous to Canisville.</p>

<p>(4.) All Evil comes from Abroad.</p>

<p>And they ordained that all doubt of these Sacred Truths was
mortal sin that could never be atoned for, neither in this world
nor in that which is to come; and that any dog who in any
speech, argument or discussion should step off these premises,
and by assertion, hint or insinuation, or even careless construction
of his sentences, should convey or cause to be conveyed,
the understanding or impression, in any degree, however
faint, that this country was not or might not be a Free Country;
that this Flag was not or might not be the Flag of Liberty; that
all Good was not or might not be indigenous; and that all Evil
did not or possibly might not come from Abroad, should be instantly
killed or fearfully mutilated. And they furthermore
proclaimed that they desired it to be known to all the world
that the dogs and fleas of Canisville and their Common Flag
were so unutterably sacred and superior to the rest of the world
that any insult or ridicule to either would be regarded as a
<i>casus belli</i>.</p>

<p>But in time the gnawings of their never ending hunger began
to perplex them sorely. How it was that God had, according to
the words of his prophets Grandadhat, Mak Tinley, Dephool
Flea, De Little Wit Blatherskite and the rest, given them the
greater blessing of a Country and a Flag, and had withholden
from them the lesser one of Victuals, bothered them very much.
Of course they were ready at a moment’s notice, when called on,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 199]</span>

to die for their Country and Flag when either was in danger,
but why they were dying every day without any notice, without
being called on, and when neither Country nor Flag was in
danger, caused them to scratch their heads. And as for that
Average of one thousand mouthfuls of good Victuals per dog
that Mak Tinley’s Statistics incontrovertibly gave them, they
couldn’t make it out at all; for to make the Average <i>out</i> they
had to make the Victuals <i>in</i>, and that they could not do for the
life of them.</p>

<p>This was how they would discuss the question. One hungry
dog would meet another on the street and thus would they say:</p>

<p><i>First Dog.</i> “Good morning, brother.”</p>

<p><i>Second Dog.</i> “It is not a good morning.”</p>

<p><i>First Dog.</i> “Whyfore, brother? Art thou not in health?”</p>

<p><i>Second Dog.</i> “No dog in Canisville is in health. Art thou?”</p>

<p><i>First Dog.</i> “Verily, no. I’m hungry.”</p>

<p><i>Second Dog.</i> “That’s strange. So am I; and yet, the great
prophet Mak Tinley, on Bamboozle Day, showed us incontrovertibly
that Statistics give every dog of us an Average of one
thousand mouthfuls of Good Victuals.”</p>

<p><i>First Dog.</i> “He did, and we all know that he is the most
truthful of the Only Original Truth Speakers; and yet I speak
the truth, too, when I state that <i>my</i> Average is about one mouthful
per every thousand days.”</p>

<p><i>Second Dog.</i> “That’s about <i>my</i> Average, too. I have examined
myself; I have felt of my stomach, and I cannot find
those one thousand mouthfuls of mine. Lord, I wish I could,
I do indeed.”</p>

<p><i>First Dog.</i> “Well, brother, it may be there is some fault or
sin in us that prevents the Blessed Statistics from giving us the
blessing. It may be that there is some wicked way within us;
some secret sin that hinders the entrance of the Average into
our stomachs. As the blessed Blatherskite saith: ‘These things
are received by Faith, not by Sight.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p><i>Second Dog.</i> “That’s so, brother; it is certainly <i>not</i> by Sight
in our case. I do believe we have not Faith enough.”</p>

<p>And so they would part, one praying to God to give him a
larger Faith, and the other praying Him to never mind the
Faith but to give him a larger Average.</p>

<p>So the demon, Doubt, again began to creep abroad in Canisville.</p>

<p>Therefore the Bamboozling Committee, carefully noting the
perplexed headshakings and the other sure signs of another
outbreak of the thinking contagion, did wisely take other precautions
to forestall it.</p>

<p>And there was a day when they and some of the Monstrous
Fleas were devising further bamboozlements for the dogs, and
a Phenomenon came also among them.</p>

<p>And the Committee said unto the Phenomenon: “Who art
thou, and whence comest thou?”</p>

<p>Then answered the Phenomenon, and said: “I am the Great
Many Headed Daily Press with the Immense Circulation; I am
four hundred square miles of nastiness; and I come from going
to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</p>

<p>And the Committee said: “And what doest thou here, Great
Daily Press?”</p>

<p>And the Great Many Headed answered, and said: “I am the
Great Gee Whizz, having a Larger Circulation than all the other
Gee Whizzes combined. I am the bold, fearless, outspoken and
independent champion of truth, honesty, uprightness and good
government, and the terror of evil doers; and I am going about
just now seeking an owner whom I may serve.”</p>

<p>“What are thy terms?” asked the Bamboozling Committee,
seeing here a possibly great aid in the Cause.</p>

<p>“My terms are one only,” replied the Phenomenon, “and are
that my master shall be the highest bidder for my services.”</p>

<p>“And what wilt thou do for us if we hire thee?” asked the
Committee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“Absolutely what ye ask me to do; for he that hireth me is
my god until a higher bidder appeareth, when I instantly transfer
my allegiance.”</p>

<p>“What we desire done now,” said the Bamboozlers, “is the
invention of handy bamboozlements to fill up the time between
one Bamboozle Day and another.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the Great Gee Whizz. “Bid high and
I am yours, and ye shall never regret your bargain.”</p>

<p>So the Bamboozling Committee asked the Monstrous Fleas
present to put up great wealth and buy him for their service,
which service, they reminded the Monstrous Fleas, was the
Public Service.</p>

<p>And the Monstrous Fleas there and then bid enormously high
for him, and bought him; and the Phenomenon did there and
then contract himself, body and soul, unto the Bamboozling
Committee and their backers, the Monstrous Fleas, to execute
their will in all things until a higher bidder for his services
should appear.</p>

<p>And they said: “O, thou Great Gee Whizz, wherewith wilt
thou persuade the dogs and bamboozle them, for they be
many?”</p>

<p>And the Phenomenon said: “Said I not unto you that I am
the Great and Everlasting Gee Whizz, and have a Greater Circulation
than all the other Gee Whizzes combined? Do I not
employ a mighty army of invisible Circulators to go and be
everywhere amongst the dogs? Behold! I will be a lying spirit
in the mouths of all these my prophets, and they shall persuade
the foolish dogs that they have found a Savior and a
Deliverer in me.</p>

<p>“I will be their Champion. I will be everywhere about them,
above and below, and will cluck-cluck with a most anxious
solicitude over them, even as a hen cluck-clucketh over her
chickens, or as Satan over them that are sealed unto him. I
will be a Holy Shekinah unto them&mdash;a pillar of dust and cloud
by day, and a pillar of fire by night; and they shall march and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 202]</span>

halt obediently as I give them the sign. I will weep and ululate
with them in their miseries and hunger, and none shall come
within leagues of me in my denunciations of the cruel and unjust
fleas that suck their blood. I will rage against you and
enrage them, and then with sound of gong and big drum, and
a raising of flags, I will give to eat unto the hungriest of them,
and they shall know that I am the Great Many Headed Gee
Whizz and Champion of the poor and the oppressed. Thus
shall I be a god unto them, going before them, and they shall
swear by me, and meekly follow whithersoever I go; and <i>I will
go your way every time</i>.</p>

<p>“I will daily and eveningly point out to them that their woes
are due not to <i>fleas</i>, but only to <i>bad</i> fleas; and every morning
and evening I will announce that I, the Great Gee Whizz, having
a Greater Circulation than all the other Gee Whizzes combined,
have a brand-new great scheme on hand, that shall infallibly
deliver them from all their woes; and every day I will astound
them with a great new disclosure of some gigantic and overshadowing
wickedness of the bad fleas, which I alone, the great
Gee Whizz, have exclusively discovered; and I will keep them
forever believing that they are just on the very point of having
all their wrongs righted, and that by <i>my</i> engineering and the
might of <i>my</i> power, a great avalanche of Good Victuals is
about to fall upon them. Thus will I be their Champion and
serve you.</p>

<p>“All the news of the day that is of no importance, and is not
thought-provoking, I will give to them, clothed in the garb of
Strict Truth; but all and any news that it may not be expedient
unto you to give them, I will suppress or so garble it that its
power to injure you shall be nullified; for you and I will own
and guard all the avenues of information, and we will make
them all converge to and pass through a sifter and a filter that I
will devise, so that these fool dogs shall get nothing but nice,
pure, wholesome, well-selected stuff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“Moreover, my Bamboozle shall every day give them wholesome
amusement. From the tropically fertile dunghills of my
Circulators’ prostituted brains, I will gather and scatter amongst
them every morning and evening, whole bouquets of the rankest
literary toadstools, skunk cabbage and stinkweeds, which
they will take, on the strength of their faith in me as the Great
Gee Whizz, for the choicest of flowers. Thus will I pervert their
noses and they shall utterly lose all discernment. Oh, I will
pour trashy, sickly, foolish, unclean and horrific blood-and-thunder
stories into their disordered brains until sober truth
shall be insipid unto them, and they shall come to hate everything
but that which raises their hair with horror and gives
them the shivers and creeps and blood curdles. Thus will I
soften their brains and imbecilitate their minds, so that they
shall be as putty to your moulding.”</p>

<p>“Enough, enough,” cried Mountebank Dephool Flea.
“Thou art my sort to a dot. If thou canst do only half what
thou proposest, thou wilt be worth to us thy weight in gold.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” cried all the rest of the Bamboozling Committee,
and the Monstrous Fleas, in chorus, “thou art indeed a Flea
Savior, sent of God in the nick of time to deliver us; perform
but a tenth of these thy promises to us, and we will make thee
as fat and wealthy as the most monstrous of us.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” laughed the Phenomenon, “ye know not the greatness
and extent of my power. Ye have devised bamboozlements,
which in the simplicity of your hearts, ye think are very fine;
but they are transient and evanescent, and of themselves will
surely fail; for they lack the essential conditions of successful
bamboozlement, namely, <i>semi-daily continuance</i>. Bamboozlements,
to be enduring, must be applied daily; and therein do I
prove my inestimable value to you, for I am the Great Many
Headed Semi-Daily Press, the Everlasting Three-Hundred-and-Sixty-five-Days-a-Year
Gee Whizz, and the Immense Circulator.</p>

<p>“But I will do more than the things I have already promised.
I will amuse them with foolish nonsense. I will every

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span>

day give them something to guess. I will offer a basketful of
rich grub to the dog that cometh nearest to solving a problem;
like this, for instance: A dog, originally fifty pounds weight,
that has had but one mouthful of meat per day for six months,
and nothing at all for the last three days, is chucked into the
hopper with an initial velocity of ten feet per second, and at an
angle of forty-five degrees; how many somersaults will he
describe before he is lost to sight, how much will he weigh, and
how many hairs will there be on his body? Or I will offer to
give a prize unto the lady flea, that in the opinion of the dogs,
is the most beautiful and popular. Or I will get up a standing-on-one-leg-the-longest
contest, with a nice meaty bone to
reward the victor. Or I will offer a reward to the dog that
shall come nearest to guessing which of all my contemporary
Gee Whizzes is the biggest liar. All these diversions will
keep them ever on the <i>qui vive</i>, to get prizes; and when every
hungry dog sees there is a chance for a good big bone for a
mere guess, he will never have time or inclination to think on
the General Misery Question.</p>

<p>“But finally, I will teach them that their great and solemn
duty is to be <i>law abiding</i> and that violence is wrong. Ye shall
make all the laws; and I will teach them to be <i>law abiding</i>. Ye
shall enact that all dogs are to be bitten and bled at the will
and pleasure of the fleas, and I will teach them that to be <i>law
abiding</i> is the highest duty of dogs; ye shall enact that no dog
has rights which any flea is bound to respect; and I will teach
the dogs that only by <i>obeying the law</i> can they obtain their
rights. Ye may trample all laws in the mire, for ye have the
police dogs to enforce your right of trampling; and I will teach
them that no dog can hope to retain the love of God and the
sympathy of the Great Public, if he goes to trampling on the
law. Ye shall enact that it is illegal for dogs to eat, and I will
teach them to be <i>law abiding</i>. Ye shall enact that hunger in
dogs is illegal, that any dog who shall either legally or illegally
ask for or try to obtain food or drink, or any other of his natural

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 205]</span>

rights, shall be deemed guilty of a crime; and I will teach
them that it is the first duty of dogs to be <i>law abiding</i>, as were
the Fathers and Prophets of our country; and to <i>obey the law</i>,
as all fleas and good citizens do.</p>

<p>“Thus will I keep all these dogs befooled, and fuddled and
muddled, so that nothing short of the direst and most unforeseen
accident will enable them to see the joke.</p>

<p>“And if any dog, by reason of these hard lines, shall growl
and make a fuss, and go to illegally taking any of his natural
rights, or in any other way make himself obnoxious to you,
and ye grow weary and want him killed, all ye need do is to
express your desire and it shall be done. I will promptly set
my innumerable Circulators to prophesy falsely against him,
to sneer him down, to ridicule him down, to write him down,
and make Public Opinion ripe for the police dogs to grab him,
and throttle him and extinguish him; for I, the Great I Am, am
an Accuser, Judge and Jury, at your service.”</p>

<p>And all the Committee and all the Monstrous Fleas rejoiced
and were glad, and said unto the Phenomenon: “Go forth
and do as thou hast said; be a lying and bamboozling spirit
unto all these dogs and Heaven bless thee.”</p>

<p>SO the Many Headed went forth and was a lying
spirit, morning and evening, in the mouths of all
its prophets. And it wrought well the will of the
Bamboozlers and the Monstrous Fleas, in deceiving
and fooling the dogs; for under its subtle ministrations
as an Angel of Light, the dogs rapidly grew
limp and idiotic in body and mind, and lost all
power of discernment between right and wrong, and good and
evil, and all taste for everything but idiotic pastimes, and silly,
trashy and horrible stories, which it daily poured into their
ears. Yea, so thoroughly were their minds debauched, enervated
and enfeebled that when the few&mdash;the very few&mdash;surviving
dogs of thought and sense, came unto them and begged
them to give a thought or two now and then to their poor,
miserable and lost condition, and the way to remedy it, the
dogs said such talk was a great weariness, and forthwith rolled
over and went to sleep.</p>

<p>And it was so that the Great Gee Whizz went up rapidly in
the favor of the Monstrous Fleas, who, in gratitude to it as their
Savior, gave it large quantities of blood to drink, so that it
grew as big and bloated as any one of the most monstrous of
them, and was given the place of honor in their assemblies

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 207]</span>

when they and the Bamboozlers held special praise meetings to
laugh and wink at each other.</p>

<p>And the Bamboozlers instructed the Great Gee Whizz to keep
up the <i>novelty</i> of its dog befoolments, and be sure and never
present the same trick twice over.</p>

<p>And the Great Gee Whizz was grieved because the Bamboozlers
seemed to think it needed any suggestion to this end;
and it suggested back to the Bamboozlers, that in fertility of
resources in bamboozlements, it could give points to them.
Therefore, the Bamboozlers did shut up, and did no more offer
suggestions to the Great Gee Whizz, the Prince of Prestidigitateurs,
Equilibrists and Acrobats.</p>

<p>For there was one trick it <i>did</i> present every day; a trick
which in its mature judgment was all the more utterly bamboozling
and confounding to the dogs, by its eternal sameness
of repetition. It was this:</p>

<p>Every morning the Many Headed appeared on high, in full
sight of the dogs and held a Solemn High Punch and Judy
Show. Concealing its body from sight behind a draping which
was figured with the Flag of the Free, it caused a few of the
Bamboozlers, whom it had previously instructed, to pull certain
strings attached to the necks of its various heads, when all the
said heads went to hissing and spitting at and punching each
other, and calling each other the vilest names. Each and every
head called each and every other a liar, a coward, and a traitor
to the ever blessed and beloved dogs, and a paid tool and toady
of the bad fleas. Each one yelled that it alone was the Only
Original Truth Speaker, and had an Immensely Greater Circulation
than all the others combined.</p>

<p>Oh, it was a goodly show, and fooled the dogs mightily, and
divided them up into sects and parties, and kept them eternally
busy cursing each other, and swearing, each, by the particular
head which each decided was the Genuine Friend and Champion
of the dogs. And not one of the poor fools could see that all of
the heads belonged to the same body.</p>

<p>So what with their much work and little food, and the daily
bamboozlements of the Many Headed, and the brain-softening
exercises of the Special Bamboozle Days, the dogs became a
gaunt mob of skinny, drivelling idiots, of flea-covered bodies
and eclipsed minds. So that when the noise of the bang and
thump instruments, and the marching dogs, and the waving of
the pretty cloths called them to the next Bamboozle day, they
came with tottering steps, and lolling tongues, and wheezing
breath, and protruding eyes. They did not run&mdash;they could
not. They came from a sense of duty to the Flag of the Free,
which the Bamboozlers had made of immense size; for they
said a great and growing country could only be fittingly typified
by a great and growing Flag, and as Freedom and Prosperity
had increased under the fostering care of Heaven, until they
had filled the whole earth about Canisville, it was meet and
merely grateful to God that the Flag fill the whole heavens too.
It was verily a heavens filling Flag, and it was raised on the tallest
and stoutest pole that could be procured from all the country
roundabout; for to-day was to be one of the maddest and gladdest
days of all the mad and glad days.</p>

<p>For Liberty in Canisville had grown so large and universal,
and the fame thereof had so gone over the pond, that a lot of
Monstrous Fleas over there, had got a lot of idiotic dogs there
to make them a great, hollow, copper idol of the form of a grotesque
looking female of human kind, which the said Monstrous
Fleas said was a Statue of Liberty, which they, in the
name (they said), and with the compliments, of the free and
hungry dogs of that land, had sent over to the Monstrous Fleas
of Canisville, to be received in the name of the free and hungry
dogs of Canisville, and set up at the gates of Canisville, as a
great visible sign that there was one great Free Country in the
world unto which the oppressed, hungry and flea-bitten dogs of
all nations might run and be saved.</p>

<p>And it was a glorious time. The Greatest Gee Whizz of All
had, with a great cyclone of noise and wind, got thousands of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span>

poor, hungry, fool dogs to pinch their bellies to raise wealth
enough to buy a pedestal to put the great hollow copper
idol on.</p>

<p>The wind and thump instruments made a mighty noise; the
pretty cloths fluttered gaily; and the poor dogs, thrilled into
enthusiasm by the sights and sounds, wagged their tails and
cheered as much as their shortness of wind and contracted
stomachs allowed. Then, at the sound of trumpet and booming
of guns, the copper idol was borne along in a grand procession
of fat, eminent, wealthy and Monstrous Fleas, and guarded by a
large body of police dogs.</p>

<p>Now, the police dogs, it was noticed, had grown quite corpulent
and greasy and consequential since the first Bamboozle
Day, and presented quite a contrast to the rest of the dogs, for
the fleas had found out that eternal good feeding is the price of
police loyalty. True, they were only dogs, and were veritable
slaves in the presence of Pup McPoodle, and the wealthy and
Monstrous Fleas, who told them to distinctly understand that
they were <i>Public</i> Servants, <i>their</i> servants, and <i>not</i> the servants
of the dogs at all, as the <i>Public</i> meant fleas only, and they were
not to give them any of their bark, on pain of being relegated
to the ranks of the dogs that had to scratch for a living; but as
they were rotund of belly, and sleek and large, and in all other
respects quite different from the common mob of dogs, they
regarded themselves as of a different caste, and their sleekness,
rotundity, and well-to-do-ism as superior-holiness marks differentiating
them from the other dogs; and although they knew
that the victuals which fed them were all forcibly taken from
the meagre supplies which the other dogs scratched up, they
ignored the fact, and held their noses up as high and consequentially
as ever they could, and mortally hated any other dog
to touch them.</p>

</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>And the Jubilation was great; the great Flag of Liberty was
floating its proudest; songs to Liberty were floating to Heaven;
her Statue was being led gloriously along, rearing aloft her head
to Heaven in magnificent symbolism of the majesty and freedom
of the nation of dogs, over whom she was now erected to be
Goddess, when a slight accidental crowding amongst the dogs,
caused some of the dirty and ill-smelling ones to be crowded so
close to the police dogs as actually to touch them.</p>

<p>Now, here was a dreadful occurrence. According to the holy
religion of the police dogs, to be even looked at by an ordinary
working, grub-hunting dog, is defilement that requires forty
days of sequestration and purification, with much fasting and
prayer; but to be <i>touched</i> by one&mdash;<i>actually touched</i>&mdash;involves
the total and irreparable loss of Paradise beyond the grave.</p>

<p>Oh, here then, was a wholesale touching of these sacred animals,
by an unsanctified and unwashen mob of beastly and
measly working dogs of the lowest caste. Horror! Peste!
Blood!! Thunder, Lightning and Death!!! For one paralyzing
instant they stood petrified with horror and terror; and then
the full realization that they had by this horrible defilement
suddenly forfeited all hope of Heaven and eternal bliss, rushed
over their brains, and, like demons, they fell on those dirty
dogs, and began to club the life out of them. The unfortunates,
shrieking and howling, fled with all the speed their diminished
breath and vitality were capable of, with the police dogs in hot
pursuit, laying about them right and left in <i>self defence</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus, in some slight degree, purged away their defilement,
and left on the scalps of those dirty dogs, many bloody
gashes, as souvenirs of Glorious Liberty, the police dogs, panting
from their victory, returned to their places; and the songs,
the procession and the worship of Liberty were resumed; the
Goddess was stood up on her pedestal; the Bamboozlers ranted
and raved about Freedom their rantingest and ravingest, the
Great Many Headed Daily Press flitted hither and thither and
everywhere, boosting up the hungry dogs to the proper pitch
of Patriotic Pride; the Heavens opened, and Freedom as an
Eagle, with specially wiped bill and claws, came down and
perched on the Goddess’ uplifted arm; the assembled fleas

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span>

gave a great shout, and, led by Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite,
Dephool Flea, Grandadhat, and the rest of the Bamboozlers,
gathered around the Flag, and sang:</p>

<p>THE Liberty Goddess consecrating was a perfect success; the dogs
were delighted and happy, and as they staggered back, hungry and weary,
to the holes and hiding places they called their homes, a sweet peace
and content was upon them. Why they were content and peaceful they did
not know and could not tell; but in a dazed and hypnotic way, they felt
that though the fleas upon them and round about them were eating them
up; though their poor bones were protruding through their skins, and
disease, and an&aelig;mia were becoming universal, they had an intangible
property they called a Free Country, a Glorious Flag, and a wonderful
Statue that in some mysterious way made them a Great Nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>And the Bamboozling Committee were delighted even unto
delirium, and they reported unto the Board of Public Safety
that God had prospered their efforts beyond their most sanguine
expectations, and that the dogs were, with perhaps a few
exceptions&mdash;whom they hoped the police would diligently
make note of, with a view to their early, total and complete extirpation
and extinction&mdash;now reduced to a very satisfactory
state of drivelling idiocy, and law abiding patriotism, and that
they could be led by the nose whithersoever the Board might
desire; that the latest acquisition to their Committee&mdash;the Great
Many Headed Daily Press, could not be too highly spoken of
for its wonderful efficiency; in fact it had&mdash;though the latest&mdash;proved
itself the greatest acquisition to their bamboozling
forces; that in fact it was more than a whole Bamboozling
Committee in itself, and could devise more and slicker dog
bamboozlements in five minutes than the whole Committee
could in five months; that its terms were very simple, being
only that they it served should be the highest bidders, which of
course meant that the dogs could never be “in it” at bidding
with the fleas, and therefore it would be at the bidding
of the fleas forever and forever, Amen. And finally
they wished to accord the Crown and the Palm to the Great
Many Headed Daily Press.</p>

<p>And the Board reported to the Government and the Monstrous
Fleas that the Country was saved, bless the Lord; that
the Period of Trouble was all safely past, thank God; that all
dangerous combinations of White Labellers were broken up
beyond all hope of future revival, Heaven be praised; that all
contagious thinking and speaking dogs were known to the
police and were marked for slaughter, with God’s help; that
the right relationship between the dogs and the fleas had been
properly defined and established, and that under Providence
all danger of the natural, God-ordained right of fleas to live on
dogs being again brought into question was passed away,
praise God; and that peace, patriotism, good order, submission

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 216]</span>

to authority, and ever-growing blood dividends, were now
established on a firm and ever enduring basis, Hallelujah.</p>

<p>All which was quite true. But there was one thing that
neither the Great Many Headed Daily Press nor the Bamboozling
Committee, nor the Government, nor the Monstrous Fleas
could devise; that no power on earth ever was able to devise;
that no power on earth ever will be able to devise; and that is,
how dogs can be starved forever and yet be made to yield the
same amount of blood to the sucking of fleas. No power ever did
it, but every power believes it can be done, and that <i>it</i> can do it.
Therefore the Canisville fleas imagined they had made all arrangements
to do it, and so settled themselves down in comfort
and peace to the everlasting bliss of drinking themselves
eternally fuller and tighter; every little flea seeing good prospects
of becoming a big flea, and every big flea looking hopefully
forward to becoming a Monstrous Flea, and every Monstrous
Flea looking savagely gleefully forward to the glorious
time when his paunch should measure miles and miles around,
and he should be simply an immense reservoir of blood, <i>blood</i>,
<span class="smcap">BLOOD</span>, BLOOD.</p>

<p>But alas! The greed of the fleas in cornering the food of the
dogs to reduce them to servility, along with their increased
avidity for their blood, overreached itself, and dogs everywhere
began to die; and as the dearth increased, the surviving ones
went insane and more savagely than ever fought and killed
one another for the odd scraps that were now to be found. And
the dying off of so many dogs threw vast multitudes of fleas <i>out
of dog</i>, and <i>they</i> began to starve too; and when they began to
starve they went, for want of dog, to fighting and devouring
one another; all which mightily pleased the Monstrous Fleas,
which did own the Blood and Bones Grindery and the Government,
and pretty nearly everything else by this time; and
they chuckled and said, “Now shall the pesky little and middle
sized fleas be starved out, and there will be all the more
blood for us, and we shall possess the earth and dwell alone in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 217]</span>

it, and grow and grow and grow until none shall be so big as
we, for we are surely the children of Heaven, and the favorites
of the Most High; yes we are.”</p>

<p>And the famine increased in Canisville, and the dogs were
sore distressed and cried aloud to Heaven for help. But the
heavens were as brass and heard not; so, turning from that
quarter, they turned to the Government and to the fleas, and
got together great multitudes of the most hungry of their number
and made unto themselves a large Flag of the Free, and
several Flags of the Hungry, and marched in procession, bearing
these on high, and also large legends such as “We want
bread,” “We want work,” “We are hungry,” “Merciful fleas,
do something for us,” “We are bloodless; oh fleas, give us
blood.”</p>

<p>And the noise of their marching was disturbing to the peace
and repose of the Monstrous Fleas, and they ordered Pup
McPoodle to order the police dogs to order it stopped; and
the chief of the police dogs, being very fat and sleek and
plethoric of blood himself, and being utterly unable to understand
what hunger meant, spake austerely unto them, and said:
“By the almighty power in me vested, as Public Functionary
of the Great Public (the fleas), this thing has got to stop right
here. What the Satan you’ve got to march for, I ken not.
What the Satan you mean by being hungry, I cannot for the
life of me comprehend. I don’t know what the word ‘Hunger’
means, but I believe it’s an illegal word and contrary to the
Constitution. [Voice in the crowd, “It is contrary to <i>our</i> constitutions,
too.”] I have been told that it means Anarchy,
which I don’t quite comprehend, but which, I know, is illegal;
consequently disperse, get out, vamose, and go away, and
don’t ever let me hear of this illegal business of getting hungry
again, or by my holy williamstick I will make things red hot
for you. I, the Almighty Tommy, have spoken.”</p>

</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>So the poor skinny dogs, withered by the red hot glance of
the Almighty Tommy’s eye, and scorched by his burning
words, and moreover having been thus so plainly caught, <i>flagrante
delicto</i>, in the illegal state of being hungry and expressing
the fact in words, did haul down their legends and their
Flags of the Hungry, and lifting up the Flag of the Free as
high as possible, in token of enhanced reverence for the Law
and the Constitution, marched back and dispersed to their several
holes and dens, where hundreds of them meekly lay down
and legally and constitutionally died of starvation, but where
they were not discovered until their poor festering corpses had
raised an illegal and unconstitutional stench.</p>

</div>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>RIGHT in the midst of all this universal
starvation and death, when
every scrap of liberty had been
taken from the dogs, and not
one dare open his mouth to say his soul or body was his own,
the Board of Public Safety suggested to the Bamboozling Committee
that now would be the most appropriate time, in the
eternal fitness of things, to get up an extra special bamboozlement
that should forever fix and clinch in the minds of the
dogs the idiotic delusion that they were free.</p>

<p>So the ever-ready Bamboozling Committee ran together and
summoned to their sitting all the glib-tongued fat fleas and salaried
barkers they could find; and President Chancy Mountebank
Dephool Flea arose and said, “Dear Friends: The state
of our town and country is very satisfactory just now. Never
in its whole history was there such a beautiful blending and
harmony of the interests of dogs and fleas as now. Our upper

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 221]</span>

class fleas are doing marvellously well. Thanks to God, dividends
are large and frequent, owing to the fact that very many
of the middle-class fleas, who alienated altogether too much
blood that rightfully belonged to us, have died off. The dogs
everywhere have been reduced to know their place, thanks to
the efforts of our brethren, Carnivorous and Phrique&mdash;to whom
our all-wise God gave the strength of his arm in the hour of
their sore need&mdash;and of our friends, Rosy Pretty Flower,
Pennzy Pattyson, Webbfoot, Gold Jay, and our faithful, paunch-bellied
police dogs. And the efforts of these our brethren,
have been most ably seconded by the preachments and ‘Thus-saith-the-Lords’
of our dearly beloved brother Tee de Little Wit
Blatherskite and his fellow fat-salaried barkers, and, above all,
by the subtle finesse of our most dearly beloved faithful servant
the Great Many Headed Daily Press. Yes, brethren, we are
indeed highly favored of God in having three such invaluable
aids to the subjugation of the dogs as the police, the Church
and the Great Daily Press&mdash;one to persuade them physically,
and the others to blind them with spiritual dust, blandishments,
seductions and lies.”</p>

<p>Here the Reverend Blatherskite and the Great Many Headed
Daily Press both closed their eyes, and piously murmured, “To
God be all the glory; we are unprofitable servants; we have
only done that which it was our duty to do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, brethren,” continued Dephool Flea, “peace and plenty
everywhere abound. Everywhere Liberty has been established
on foundations that shall nevermore be shaken; and I think,
as we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to God for these manifold
mercies, we could not show it better than by getting up to
his glory a grand old final something or other in honor of Liberty,
Freedom, Deliverance and all that&mdash;a regular sneezer,
you know, a tip-top, <i>ne plus ultra</i> sort of bamboozle that shall
beat all creation.”</p>

<p>Up jumped then the Great Many Headed Daily Press and
said: “I have it. What these dogs need now, above all things,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 222]</span>

is more stuff about Liberty. Ye cannot work this theme too
much. It is the liberty stealer’s and the tyrant’s best guise,
you know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I object,” interrupted a fat flea, excitedly, “to the use of
the terms ‘liberty stealer’ and ‘tyrant’ as applied to us.”</p>

<p>“Order, order;” commanded President Dephool Flea. “Of
course we all know well enough what we are after, but I suggest
to our beloved servant, the Great Many Headed, that, all
things considered, it <i>would</i> be better not to call ourselves by
our right names even here in our privacy. It will subserve our
great cause better to try to believe, ourselves, the bamboozling
lies we tell the poor fool dogs. To bamboozle ourselves a little
enables us to appear more sincere and serious to them. Therefore
the Great Daily Press will please not tell the truth even
here.”</p>

<p>“I beg leave to withdraw the offensive truth, then,” said the
Great Gee Whizz. “As I was saying, that Statue business was
a grand stroke of dog bamboozlement, over which ye fleas
ought to laugh to your dying day. Then keep it up. Give
these dogs plenty of Liberty talk, Liberty sentiment, and Liberty
fakes to celebrate and shout over, and ye can bind them
with as many slavish bonds as ye may choose to put upon
them. Set them to make the heavens ring with Liberty’s
acclaim, and while they are busy with that, ye can filch all
their rights away. Do ye hear me?”</p>

<p>And all the Bamboozlers answered, “Aye, we hear.”</p>

<p>“Very good then,” said the Many Headed, “dogs have one
great weakness, and that weakness is their silly love of noise
and show. All history shows, and all our experience proves,
that nothing fetches dogs so quick as noise, racket, din and
gaudy show. Low, coarse, undiscerning simpletons, they are
all animal sensibility, and have not yet developed the ability to
pick truth from error, reality from show, and fraud out of its
fine garments of honesty; gumps and boobies, they are pleased
with a rattle and tickled with a straw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>“Work then, therefore, along the line of their strongest weakness.
Give them noise to make, and plenty of it; something to
make an idiotic din with; something to make them happy and
shout. Let us make them a Bell, a big Bell, an enormous Bell;
and we will call it a Liberty Bell. And so bewitched and superstitionized
are they now with everything that is called Liberty
that without more ado they will fall down and worship it.
Then we will set them all to hammer on it, and the noise of the
hammering thereof will please the poor idiots immensely; and
then with our solemnest visages, we will call the noise the
Proclamation of Liberty; at which bewitching words they will
all fall down and worship again. So shall their befoolment,
imbecilitation and enslavement be clinched and confirmed for
ever, and ye fleas shall reign supreme, and suck their blood for
ever and ever, Amen.”</p>

<p>“Bravo! Bravo!” cried all the fleas in chorus. “Good!
Grand! give ’em a Bell, poor imbeciles; anything to please
’em; noise is cheap, and Liberty metal costs less than Liberty
itself.”</p>

<p>And the suggestion of the Great Many Headed Gee Whizz
seemed good unto the Committee, and they made him Minister
Plenipotentiary in the matter. And he went and sent his Circulators
abroad amongst the dogs, to tell them that a grand
new pleasure had been devised for them; that <i>their</i> prosperity,
<i>their</i> glory, <i>their</i> independence, <i>their</i> National Wealth, their
unexampled LIBERTY, were all agoing to be celebrated with a
Bell, a big Bell, a nonpareil Bell, that should weigh <i>thirteen
thousand pounds</i>, and, with gorgeous ceremonies, should be
baptized a LIBERTY BELL, to the honor of God and the
glory of themselves; and the show would be worth going many
miles to see; and every Tom, Dick, Harry and Jack was agoing
to hammer on it, in honor of everything and everybody, at
every hour of day and night; and the noise of it would be beau-u-u-tiful,
and it would be so loud, and there would be such a
lot of it that the heavens would be just full of it; that all the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span>

angels would knock off their regular business and make a great
holiday to listen to it; and we should all prostrate ourselves
and tell God what a wise thing he did when he passed by all
the other dogs in the world and picked US out to be the recipients
of such wealth and glory and Liberty as he had deluged
us with.</p>

<p>And the dogs were delighted with the prospect of so much
glory, and paid great attention to do as they were told.</p>

<p>Then in due time, the Great Daily Press announced that the
Bamboozling Committee had appointed themselves, in the
name of the dogs, to devise a Bell and to superintend all the
ceremonies.</p>

<p>Then they proclaimed abroad that as all, both dogs <i>and</i> fleas,
were the recipients of Heaven’s blessings of wealth and Freedom,
and as this Bell was to be an emblematic Bell, all, both
dogs <i>and</i> fleas, must contribute something towards the making
of it; so that when its voice should be hammered out, it should
be the voice of <i>all</i>. Therefore every one must bring a bit of
metal of some sort and cast it into the fire.</p>

<p>And on a day appointed, the fleas and the dogs were gathered
around the melting pot; and the fleas, being very wealthy,
sent in, with much ostentation, gold and silver, and nickel,
which they called Liberty Metal, and which with prayer was
cast into the fire; and the dogs, being very poor, went about
and scratched up old bits of junk tin, and iron and brass, and
brought them, and with prayer cast them into the fire; then all
the salaried barkers said grace over the melting mass; and the
ever-ready Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite, explained that the
emblematic meaning of this unifying fusion of all these heterogeneous
elements, was that we all, though fleas and dogs, poor
and rich, small and great, white and black, weak and strong,
were really only <i>one</i>, having all interests in common, and that
as in this grand composite Bell, the glory of each component
part was merged in the glory of the whole, so the glory of each
in this nation&mdash;poor and rich, top and bottom&mdash;was merged in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 225]</span>

the glory of the whole of us; in short, the E Pluribus Unum of
the Bell typified the E Pluribus Unum of <i>us</i>.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>
<div class="figcenter">

</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>And all the podgy and paunch-bellied fleas, at this lucky discovery
of the beautiful hidden meaning of the fusing mass, set
up a great asthmatic shout of praise, which contagious example
caused the dogs to give out delirious howls of joy, too. For
although it would have puzzled the smartest of them to discover
the real actualities of the glorious things thus typified, they
could see that the typification in the pot was all real and made
a very fine show.</p>

<p>Then a herald came forth and proclaimed aloud that the potful
was cooked enough, and was about to be solemnly poured
out&mdash;the grandest libation to Liberty the world had ever seen&mdash;and
that the Committee of Arrangements had decreed that as

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 226]</span>

an appropriate ceremony, accompanying, all the dogs stand on
their heads and kick their hind legs in the air, to signify Freedom
and defiance to all the world.</p>

<p>And at a signal the great ladleful was tipped over, and the
white hot stream ran into a great mould; the fleas shouted “Te
Deum,” and fell down in as flat adoration as their rotund carcases
allowed, the salaried barkers shed from their closed eyes
great salt drops of ecstasy; the dogs stood on their heads and
flourished their hind legs, and the Great Many Headed Gee
Whizz stepped forth and announced that Liberty, glorious,
heaven-born Liberty, had put on her metallic petticoat.</p>

<p>Now, some of the dogs who were so weak that they could
not, and a few who were dull of comprehension and said they
did not see the connection between standing on their heads
and Liberty, objected to reverse themselves. Whereupon the
police dogs drew their williamsticks and belabored them therewith,
saying this was Liberty Day, and the beautiful show was
not agoing to be spoilt by a lot of pesky dogs doing as they liked.
They had got to stand on their heads and flourish; them was
the orders, and, by Hokey, any dog that refused that day to
honor Liberty, Freedom and Independence, was agoing to be
made to; and what did they mean by refusing to be free,
like everybody else?</p>

<p>And when those dogs replied that a Liberty that did not
allow them to stand on their feet in a natural manner was tyranny,
the police dogs smote them a smite on the jaw, and told
them to shut up and do like the others; and on their refusal,
they clubbed them out of the crowd, which hissed condemnation
of their offence.</p>

<p class="blockindent10"><span class="smcap large">More Liberty Bell.&mdash;Liberty Earth.&mdash;Liberty Tree.&mdash;Liberty

</div>

<div class="topspace3"></div>

<p>THEN the herald proclaimed again that, the Creation being ended, all
would adjourn for a week for the Bell to cool, the week to be spent in
blowing up their patriotic fervor to the maximum incandescence, and
filling their lungs for a fortissimo shout for Liberty on the seventh
day.</p>

<p>And the poor dogs did as they were bid. And on the seventh day all
gathered to the lifting up of the Bell. And when it was lifted up, the
fleas, being very strong and vigorous, did most of the shouting, but
the dogs, being very weak for lack of food, did shout very poorly.
Nevertheless, the Great Daily Press shut all its eyes, and proclaimed
abroad that the shout for Liberty that day was the Great United Shout of
One Great United Nation of free, prosperous and happy dogs.</p>

<p>Then said the Bamboozling Committee unto the Great Daily
Press, “Oh, thou Great Gee Whizz, on what sacred high place
shall we hang this Sacred Vibrator, that its voice may be heard
around the world?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>And the Great Gee Whizz answered and said, “The Eternal
Fitnesses require that everything that can emblematize our
glorious liberties be gathered around this central emblem.
Therefore, let Liberty Earth be gathered, and a Liberty Tree be
planted therein, to the baptism of Liberty Holy Water, and let
the fairest limb thereof be selected as a Liberty Limb, and
thereon hang the Liberty Bell, facing the Liberty Goddess, and
from the top of the tree let the sacredest emblem of all&mdash;the
Flag of Liberty&mdash;proudly and defiantly float, that Liberty may
be complete and perfect.”</p>

<p>And the Bamboozling Committee said the conception was
that of a master mind, and should be done. And they sent
some very learned and paunchy fleas to a place where, according
to tradition, several fighting dogs, eminent in the battle
against the Kyhidom dogs, had lain down and scratched themselves
and slept the night before, and which had smelt extraordinarily
strong of patriotic dog for a long time after. There was
also a spot where the great leader in that fight, having got a fly
up his nose, had stood and sneezed tremendously; and the spot
where his fore feet had stood during his convulsion had been
marked with remembrance sticks from that day.</p>

<p>These spots, they said, were, therefore, Holy Ground; and
they ordered several poor dogs, that had been specially fumigated
and cleansed and consecrated for the occasion, to take
Consecrated Shovels, and reverently and, to the accompaniment
of solemn chanting by several solemn salaried barkers, dig up
some of that Sacred Dirt and put it reverently in Consecrated
Pots and Tins and carry it in solemn procession to the Sacred
Spot, where the Liberty Tree was to be planted.</p>

<p>And they solemnly dumped it there, and the Holy-Dirt-touched
Pots and Shovels were afterwards put away on a Consecrated
Shelf in the Church of the Fleas. And it was so that in
after days, many came to worship the Blessed Pots and Tins and
Shovels that had been touched by the Liberty Earth on which
the ancient dogs had lain and scratched and sneezed; and whosoever

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 229]</span>

looked at them was made Free, and received power to
make others Free; and whosoever touched them was made whole
of any disease he had, and received power to heal anyone else.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_229.jpg" alt="Illustration: THE TREE OF LIBERTY." width="500" height="508" />
</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Then the Bamboozling Committee sent another paunch-bellied
and learned lot of fleas, to where was a tree, against
which certain big dogs that had distinguished themselves in
the said battle against the Kyhidom dogs, had rubbed themselves
vigorously when they had the itch. Here, said they, was
a tree whose bark had actually been rubbed by, and afforded
relief to, those noble dogs whose teeth and claws had torn out
the eyes and bowels of their enemies, and stopped the exactions
of the foreign fleas of Kyhidom, and had established that
glorious Liberty by which the interests of the native suckers
of Canisville had been so gloriously compacted and built up.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span>

This, then, was the Tree of Liberty, on which the Blessed Bell
of Liberty should hang.</p>

<p>And it was so. And they made the specially fumigated, consecrated
dogs transplant it into the Liberty Earth. And on the
day of the Solemn Hanging, The Holy Tintinnabulator was
escorted with shouts of joy, and to the vociferous chanting of a
magnificent Jubilate Deo, and set up on the Liberty Limb of
the Liberty Tree.</p>

<p>And there was a great noise made with the blow, bang and
thump instruments; and the dogs wept with a thankful joy for
all the wondrous liberties which these things demonstrated
unto them; and the salaried barkers went amongst them and
gathered up their joyful tears, and poured them at the sacred
roots of the Sacred Tree, and said a sacred grace over the pouring;
and the fleas gathered around and snivelled with them,
and made a right beautiful talk about “<i>Our</i> Common Liberties,”
“<i>Our</i> National Glory,” “<i>Our</i> United Interests,” “<i>Our</i> Great
Wealth,” and <i>our</i> everything else; and then the great Flag of
the Free was run up on high, and a herald came forth and blew
a trumpet, and proclaimed that if any dog knew of any just
cause or impediment why all this gallant show and emblemism
should not be considered proof irrefragable that they were the
fairest, fattest, and freest lot of dogs and fleas that ever God
Almighty’s sun shone on, or ever would shine on, he should
now declare the same, or forever hold his peace; but, nevertheless,
if any such measly and discreditable dog dare get up and
deny it, he would instantly be strung up to the highest gallows
as a traitor.</p>

<p>So no one accepting the challenge, the ceremonies proceeded
and Chancy Mountebank Dephool Flea&mdash;with a solemn wink
to the other Bamboozlers, who solemnly winked back to him&mdash;in
the name of E Pluribus Unum, and countless thousands of
free, united, fat, prosperous and happy dogs, pulled the mighty
tongue of the Bell; and as the mighty tone of the hammered
metal rose upon the trembling air, and went up in a majestic

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 231]</span>

volume to Heaven, all the Bamboozlers and the Monstrous Fleas
closed their eyes and turned their noses heavenward, and wept
great copious tears of gratitude and joy; all the salaried barkers
closed <i>their</i> eyes and turned <i>their</i> noses to heaven and wept
likewise, and all the dogs prostrated themselves and wept with
joy until all the earth around was wet. At which moment of
solemn joy a Heavenly Voice from under the Bell pealed forth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent14">Hallelujah!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallelujah!</div>
   </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The pealing of this hymn held all the dogs entranced, and as
the last beautiful note died away, they all wept, and said it was
lovely poetry; too lovely for anything; especially where the
life-knell of the Bell thrills the hearts of the dead dogs under
the sod; and the Bell with its long and facile flaming tongue
writes names on the sky.</p>

<p>Then President Dephool Flea, after waiting a few rapturous
moments to let the beautiful words soak into their souls, announced

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 232]</span>

that “<i>our</i>” liberties having now been duly established,
and acknowledged of Heaven, the Blessed Bell was now open
for every one to hammer his gratitude to God on, and that each
would take a turn in order.</p>

<p>Which they did. All the fat, eminent and Monstrous Fleas
gathered in single file, and passed before the Bell and hammered
it, giving one blow for himself, and thirteen times and forty-four
times and six times, on behalf of the all-glorious liberties,
wealth, prosperity and happiness of the dogs. And everybody
was delighted, especially the big fleas, who said it was the very
best amusement they had ever had in their lives; and they
begged the Bamboozling Committee to keep it up, for, far
beyond all considerations of the amusement of it, it was the
bulliest piece of dust throwing ever yet devised for blinding
those d&mdash;&mdash; fool dogs.</p>

<p>So the Bamboozling Committee and the Great Many Headed
Gee Whizz, put their wits together again; and the ever fertile
Daily said that, as he had foretold, the Bell racket and show
had pleased the dogs immensely, the Committee should go on
giving them emblems to look at and noise to make. “But,”
said he, “let us give them a chance to make the noise themselves.
Ye and the other fleas have had all the hammering so
far; let them do it now. I propose we get them to make an
emblematic Rope, a long Rope, a strong Rope, and a Rope they
can pull the old Bell clapper all together with.</p>

<p>“Set them to make a Rope that shall be emblematic of their
common wealth, their common caninity, their common Liberty,
their common dirt, their common itch, their common hunger&mdash;their
common everything. Let each one strip a few hairs off his
hide and his tail, and bring them as an offering to Liberty, and
let all those hairy contributions be spun into a great Liberty
Rope. Then one end thereof shall be attached to the great
clapper, and as many of the dogs as can shall get hold and
pull; and it shall be pull and bang, and bang and pull, and
pull and bang, until the poor imbeciles will go mad and crazy

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 233]</span>

with the delightful racket; and the noise shall fill their bellies&mdash;which,
you know, is the cheapest kind of victuals.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the Great Gee Whizz!” cried the Bamboozlers,
“Liberty Noise and Liberty Ropes are cheaper than Liberty.”</p>

<p>And, as before, The Great Daily Press, with awful solemnity,
publicly announced that the dogs were agoing to have more
emblems to celebrate their glorious liberties and privileges with.</p>

<p>And when the dogs heard the great emblematic Liberty Rope
proposition, they wagged their tails and howled deliriously for
joy, and went lachrymoniously drivelling to each other that
Canisville was indeed the place where Freedom dwelt, and
that no other dogs on the face of the earth had a Liberty Bell,
Liberty Poetry and a Liberty Rope; no indeed.</p>

<p>And the dogs hasted and each stripped some hair off his tail
and hide, and sent it to the Bamboozling Committee, who, in
the privacy of their meeting place, had it spun, to the accompaniment
of many a wink and many a hilarious laugh over the
silly idiots that were so easily&mdash;oh, so very easily&mdash;buncoed and
bamboozled out of Liberty, by Liberty emblems and shams.</p>

<p>And when the great common Rope was ready, they ordained
another day of howling thanksgiving, and self laudation, and
self glorification, and a solemn moment of attachment of the
end thereof to the glorious Banger of the glorious Bell, and a
solemn consecration and dedication of the Rope, and another
grand hymn, which called all the angels from their most pressing
engagements to crowd Heaven’s battlements, in admiration
of their magnificently idiotic jubilation.</p>

<p>And the dogs were tickled to death with their Rope, and took
turns of gangs at pulling it; and the eternal banging and clanging
and jangling of the hammered metal was so delightful that
they forgot their hunger even; and they danced around the
Bell, <i>and kissed it</i>, and touched it reverently with their noses,
and blessed God for Liberty, Liberty, Liberty.</p>

<p>And at the suggestion of the Great Gee Whizz, the Bamboozling
Committee made a multitude of little tinkling bells, verisimilitudes

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 234]</span>

of the Great Bell, and touched each one on the Great
Bell, and it was so that virtue went out of the Great Bell and
made a true Liberty Tinkler of the little one.</p>

<p>And the Committee ordained that each truly patriotic dog
hang a Liberty Tinkler on the end of his nose, one in each of
his ears, and a row of them on his tail, to the end that all the
world and everybody else might hear the noise of Liberty, and
that every dog, at every movement of his body and wag of his
tail, might be a living, eternal Proclamation of Liberty throughout
the land.</p>

<p>And it was so. And the dogs were delighted and hung little
Liberty Tinklers upon themselves as ordered; and all Canisville
rang with Liberty.</p>

<p>But in a short time the fat fleas, and the eminent fleas, and
the Monstrous Fleas, seeing that the Blessed Bell and the Liberty
ceremonies had quite served their purpose, and the poor
fool dogs had been hypnotized into a very satisfactory state of
forgetfulness of their wrongs and miseries, told the Bamboozling
Committee that they might now with safety conclude the
amusement and close up the show, as it was somewhat expensive.</p>

<p>So the Bamboozling Committee, ordering one grand final
hammering, that made the startled angels jump, and a grand
final yell for Liberty, which made the air tremble for a week
after, and a benediction in chorus by all the salaried barkers,
that sounded like the last tapering-off roll of distant thunder,
declared the greatest and grandest show of the ages closed.</p>

<p>THE bamboozle of the Bell of Liberty had been a grand success while
it lasted. As a dream, a stimulating mental narcotism, a beautiful
period of sweet oblivion, into which the hard and cruel facts of the
dogs’ daily lives had been thrown and temporarily buried, it was very
restful and enjoyable to them. But starvation, disease and universal
tyranny, though buried, were not decreed out of being; and scarcely had
the last tones of sweet Liberty’s Bell died out and the show closed, ere
those horrid realities began to creep and sneak from their graves and smite the
yet dazed and dreaming dogs. With skeleton hands they smote
them on the head and in the stomach, and with mercilessly
cruel fingers poked open their hypnotized eyes, and with fiendish
laughter mocked them, and bade them look and see that in
spite of Liberty Shows of every sort, the times were somehow
out of joint. Times were indeed bad. Gaunt Famine, gaunter

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 236]</span>

than ever, stalked through the land, smiting down her victims
more pitilessly than ever, as though in jealous revenge for the
attentions they had lately lavished on her rival, Liberty. Of
course the dogs did the starving&mdash;most of it; but as the dogs
were the source of the fleas’ existence, why, even many of <i>them</i>
fell sick of hunger and dwindled away and died. Even the
police dogs, for whom Pup McPoodle and all the Monstrous
Fleas made extra special strenuous efforts to keep in good flesh,
seeing that their zeal for Order depended entirely on that, did
suffer somewhat from the stringency. They did not always get
their basketfuls punctually, and were several times delayed in
their dining, and they began to grumble and complain that if
this kind of outrage on their sacred carcases were not soon
stopped, they would get up a riot on their own hook and club
somebody, for they had never been used to being hungry, and
by the great Holy Locust, they were not going to be, either,
without knowing the reason why.</p>

<p>Irreligion, Vice, Crime and Immorality stalked abroad, and
gave the multitudinous compulsory-virtue societies a tremendous
rush of business, insomuch that they had to work overtime.
But an evil of far more portentousness and gravity than
all these combined ensued: the salaried barkers in the churches
had their basketfuls diminished; their churches were sometimes
empty and were never full.</p>

<p>Therefore, as the salaried barkers had, through long experience,
come to observe that a famine was nearly always accompanied
by what they called a “great outpouring of the spirit,”
and the setting in of a great “revival,” and as a “revival” meant
fuller churches, and consequently a revival of the supplies of
meat, they determined to hump themselves with great energy,
and bring about the revival that, according to the famine, was
now about due. So they called a conference of all the fat fleas,
the eminent fleas, and the most pious of the Monstrous Fleas,
and the barking dogs, not only of Canisville, but of the country
roundabout, to devise newer and better schemes for what they

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span>

called “reaching the masses,”&mdash;or “them asses” as one totally
depraved dog profanely remarked.</p>

<p>And it was a great time. For weeks all the lady fleas, and
all other fleas who were in “sympathy” with the dogs, and
had their “welfare” at heart, were busy every day in getting a
place ready for the reception of the conference. It was fitted
up “regardless of expense,” and decorated especially with
costly flowers, and mottoed banners, and choice texts of “Holy
Scripture,” exquisitely wrought in gold and silver, on expensive
silks. The air was heavy with perfumes of the rarest
sorts; the walls were resplendent with mirrors and pictures,
loaned by the wealthiest suckers; and everything that could be
done <i>was</i> done to minister to the “solemnity” of the occasion,
and to the comfort of the most eminent and fat-salaried barkers&mdash;the
D. D.’s, L.L. D.’s, B. A.’s, M. A.’s, Reverends, Very
Reverends, Much Reverends, Right Reverends, Wrong Reverends,
Right Reverend Fathers in God, His Grace, His Eminence,
His Sacredness, His Holiness, who had been invited
from far and near, to assist Heaven in bringing about the
“revival.” And a great and shining galaxy of fat and Monstrous
Fleas, with “Professor,” “Honorable,” “Right Honorable,”
“His Nibs,” “His Nobs,” “His Jags,” “His Jiblets,” “His
Joblots,” to their names were there also. Oh, they were a highly
select and respectable and well-conditioned body of fleas and
barkers that met together that day to devise the ways and means
of making poor dogs happy.</p>

<p>Now it was remarked that to this great conference of the
pious fleas and their salaried barkers to devise the salvation of
dogs <i>not a solitary poor working dog was invited</i>, and no one
even called to ask the opinion of any dog on the subject; but
all the eminent and pious fleas there proceeded to make
speeches, which were duly taken down and recorded in the
book of the chronicles of the world’s eminent saints, who have
spent their lives trying to lift up the poor, while riding on their
backs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>And Tee de Little Wit Blatherskite, who had had a good
breakfast and was more than usually full of divine zeal, said
they were grieved beyond expression to find that, in spite of the
efforts that had been expended for the benefit of poor dogs,
their poverty, discontent and irreligion were on the increase.
But not this alone; for lately it had come to their knowledge
that far more alarming symptoms had broken out. In several
quarters, it was rumored, there had appeared several strange
dogs of uncouth visage and long hair, who had evidently determined
to poison the minds of the whole community of dogs.</p>

<p>These abominable new comers&mdash;who they hoped for the honor
of Canisville were from some foreign country&mdash;had spoken evil
of religion, saying it was only a crafty dodge of the fleas to
deceive dogs with and to hide from them the fact that <i>the only
thing that was amiss with dogs was</i> FLEAS. And these same
foreign dogs had even gone so far as to call fleas SUCKERS
and other wicked epithets, and to tell the dogs that until they
got rid of the fleas they would never get rid of their miseries.
Now, brethren, here a real peril menaced them; here, brethren,
were the hateful devils of Singletaxism, Anarchism, Communism,
Socialism, Populism, Nationalism, and many other
blasphemous anti-flea isms, shoving their noses in our midst,
and God only knew what the end of it was to be. Here were
certain lewd dogs of the baser sort&mdash;idle, good-for-nothing
agitators, no doubt, who lived on their more simple, honest and
law abiding fellow-dogs&mdash;going about preaching the pestilent
doctrines of social discontent, and free thought, and equal
rights, and setting class against class&mdash;yes, brethren, <i>setting
class against class</i>; only think of it!&mdash;and was nothing to be
done? Were they to sit there supinely looking on while those
vile foreign agitators were undermining the very foundations of
Religion and Social Order? Why, it might actually come to
pass, if some energetic measures were not immediately undertaken,
that the whole race of dogs would grow to hate the race

Frankoland, which would result in putting back the cause of
Religion a hundred years, as it had done there. Oh, brethren,
it was time to be up and doing. Oh, brethren, scepticism and
infidelity were taking hold of dogs nowadays. Oh, brethren,
could we not revive the laws against blasphemy, and the use of
the Blue Thunderbolts with which to <i>protect the Almighty</i>?
Had we no jails and gallows to protect us and keep these dogs in
the paths of true religion? Oh, brethren, only a few days ago, as
one of our most fat and pious pew holders was on his way to
church, he was insulted by some dogs who, no doubt, had imbibed
the pestilent heresies now being preached. They barked
out at him: “There goes a sucker. That’s the son-of-a-gun what
keeps us thin and poor;” and made other insolent and ungrammatical
remarks, and one vile fellow slyly threw a gob of
mud that hit him on the paunch. Oh, brethren, it needed
great grace and entire sanctification for our brother to bear it.
And no doubt, brethren, something was urgently needed to
reach the masses.</p>

<p>Then the conference adjourned for recess and luncheon,
which consisted of every sort of costly viands, served on costly
plate; of rare and costly fruits, and wines of exquisite “bouquet,”
all set out amid a display of the very rarest exotics, that cost
exceeding much wealth, and to the accompaniment of an orchestra
of very talented minstrels.</p>

<p>This over, and “thanks” having been rendered by His Grace,
the Serene and Excessively Distinguished Archiepiscopus of
the Diocese of Puliciania, who had travelled a thousand miles
“to be present on this auspicious occasion,” the session was reopened
with prayer by the Veriest Reverend Father in God,
Sanguineous F. Plumpdog.</p>

<p>Now, His Grace, the Serene and Excessively Distinguished
Archiepiscopus of the Diocese of Puliciania, was a very large,
fat and wheezy dog who could hardly see out of his eyes for
fatness. He had lived amongst, and ministered to a churchful
of big fat fleas so long that he had come to regard himself as
one of them, and always said “we” and “us” and “our.” So
did all the rest of these wonderfully sleek and plump barkers;
and so acceptable were these barkers to their various congregations
of fat and Monstrous Fleas and so uniformly did they
never preach any other than an “acceptable” gospel to them,
that the fleas were pleased to regard them as of their caste.</p>

<p>The first speaker was the Most Reverend, Asthmatic and Holy
Archdeacon, Suckerius P. Paunchiana Fatdog, F. L. U. N. K.
E. Y., H. U. M. B. U. G., who made a few remarks thus: “Ladies
and Gentlefleas&mdash;It seems to me that we, to whom has been
committed, <i>by the wisdom of Almighty God</i>, the keeping of
great wealth, ought first to guard against the danger of forgetting
that we owe something to the poor dogs whom God, <i>in His
wisdom has put in a position beneath us</i>. We ought never to
forget that it is to us that God looks, <i>as his chosen instruments</i>,
for the uplifting of the dogs. Why there are dogs and why
there are fleas is one of those inscrutable mysteries that we ought
not to pry into, but reverently accept. For my part, I reverently

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 241]</span>

accept it, and I pray that I may ever be kept reverent. Certain
it is, however, that if ever the dogs are to be made fat and
happy, and uplifted to those things of the soul and Heaven, we
fleas will have to do it. God always works through means, <i>and we
are the means</i>. He has ordained the wealthy to minister to the
poor, the strong to bear with the weak, the wise to lead the foolish,
the enlightened to illumine the dark; we are the wealthy, the
strong, the wise, and the enlightened, and woe to us if we shirk
the duty thus laid upon us. Brethren, the one thing we are
most apt to forget is <span class="smcap">the Spirit of Christ</span>. He came <i>down</i>
from his high estate to uplift the fallen, and it is this going
down, <i>going down</i>, <span class="smcap">GOING DOWN</span>, brethren, to those below us,
that is going to save them.</p>

<p>“Let us then carry out this Spirit, and go <i>down</i> to these poor
creatures. Let us walk amongst them; let us show ourselves
to them; let us put on poor raiment and ask them how they do;
let us teach them scientific economy in eating; let us with our
own paws show them how one bone can be made to yield a
good dinner for a large family and leave something over for the
morrow; let us teach them how to accept in a proper spirit the
cast-off garments of the “charitable,” and to seek to be clothed
with the “garments of righteousness”; let us invite them to
confide to us their trials and troubles; let us take a genuine interest
in them, and get into their affections, and teach them toil,
and thrift, and temperance, and so, by easy and natural methods&mdash;such
as wrapping up pennies and candies in tracts and leaflets&mdash;gradually
train their minds to those higher and eternal
things and treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust
break through and steal.”</p>

<p>And all the audience broke out into a storm of applause; and
everybody said that was a most glorious gospel, the Gospel of
GOING DOWN. And everybody looked anxious to get up and
go down then and there. And an enthusiastic Monstrous Flea
moved, and another enthusiastic one seconded, that “We do,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span>

here and now, all of us, form ourselves into an Association to be
known as the ‘Going Down Organization Society,’” which was
carried with immense enthusiasm.</p>

<p>AFTER a short interval, to enable the assembly to recover from the
stunning effect of the great Gospel of Going Down, there stepped forward
His Grace, the Veriest, Mostest, Reverendest Archbishop Plethoric
Dog, L.I.C.K.F.O.O.T. &pound;. s. d., $$$$$$, of the diocese of Upper
Suckerdom and all Flunkeydom. He said: “Brethren, the called and chosen,
the divinely-appointed almoners of Heaven’s bounty, I congratulate my
most Reverend, Asthmatic and Holy Brother, Archdeacon Suckerius P.
Paunchiana Fatdog, upon the very able manner in which he has presented
before you the Gospel of Going Down, and you on the happiness and good
fortune of listening to him. I can only support my brother by pointing
out how we can <i>apply</i> his Going Down Gospel. It has struck me that we
can make use of many means which may be sanctified to their good.</p>

<p>“My brethren, there is the means of <i>Music</i>, which may be
used to uplift poor dogs. It is well known that even dogs have
a love of <i>Music</i> quite as strong as the most cultivated of fleas.
Why not give these dogs <i>Cheap Music</i>? Let us provide for

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 244]</span>

them bands of music to play in the public places, say, one day
in a week. Who knows what the fiddle and the bow, the
trombone and piccolo, the cornet and oboe, the flute and violoncello,
the cymbals and the banjo, the triangle and the drum, may
accomplish, when handled with consecrated paws, and blown
with sanctified breath? Let us show these degraded dogs that
we love them, that we are blood of their blood, and are anxious
to minister to their love of the beautiful in sight and sound.
And, my brethren, we can make even music serve the cause of
the church, and the means of drawing them to the sanctuary&mdash;which,
of course, should be the aim and the object of all our
efforts. We need not discourse unto them unsanctified jigs,
and profane waltzes, and blasphemous schottisches, by which
Satan beguiles the ungodly. No, no! There is a great multitude
of beautiful pieces of music that have an upward and
churchward tendency, that may be discoursed unto them, such
as, ‘I am so happy I’m going to heaven’; ‘I desire to be an
angel’; ‘My home is not here, it is over there’; ‘I am looking
above to the heaven of love’; ‘There is a happy land, <i>far</i>,
<span class="smcap">FAR</span> away’; and many others; and all these have a very good
tendency to keep the minds of dogs fixed on things above and
away from their sordid poverty and wicked trifling with the
vain nonsense of trying to make this poor sin-stricken world
any better.</p>

<p>“Oh, brethren, there is nothing more entrancing, more uplifting,
more heartmelting, than to hear ‘Go bury thy troubles’
piously rendered by the cornet, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer,
and all kinds of music. I have seen dogs melted to tears
under it; and I make no doubt that many souls will be drawn
to Church by it; and above all, in the present alarming state of
dog-scepticism, it will have a good effect in drawing away their
minds from the discussion of what they wickedly call their
‘wrongs.’</p>

<p>“Then there is the love of art that may be appealed to.
Dogs love to look at beautiful pictures. Why not open a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 245]</span>

picture gallery free for them all to come and gaze their fill? Of
course, God, in his wisdom, has given <i>us</i>, alone, the power to
buy pictures, but he did not intend us to be hoggish with
them; He no doubt intended that we should share these our gifts
with our inferior fellow creatures. Did not our great Master
teach us to share our gifts with them? Yea, verily; and just
as He, by coming down and imparting his gifts to <i>us</i>, has uplifted
<i>us</i>, and made <i>us</i> to sit in heavenly places, so we by the same
conduct can uplift those who, by natural and divine ordination,
are very wisely placed beneath us. Of course, we cannot hope
ever to abolish their poverty, and put them on to our plane;
for it is evident that the Almighty, in his wisdom, made dogs
to be inferior, just as he made fleas to be superior. And it is
just as evident that he ordained dogs to support fleas, in return
for the inestimable benefits, both moral and spiritual, that fleas
confer on dogs. Ye can easily see, my brethren, that fleas are
absolutely necessary to the well being of dogs. Fancy a community
of dogs without fleas! Who would lead them? Who
would watch for their souls’ welfare? Who would ameliorate
their condition of want and ignorance? Who would have the
leisure to go about amongst them, visiting them in their kennels,
soothing their sorrows, binding up their sore places, calming
their discontent with their divinely appointed lot, and
pointing them to a Better Land, when they kick the bucket?</p>

</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>“Brethren, what I meant to say before I digressed, is, that as
one means of grace&mdash;a very great means of very great grace&mdash;I
rank sanctified pictures and sanctified song very high. Yes,
brethren, let us open a picture gallery, <span class="smcap">FREE</span> as salvation,
‘without money and without price,’ open every day and evening
in the year, except Sundays and during Lent, and the
Saints’ days, and solemn feasts and solemn fasts, and Thanksgiving
and holidays and other solemn occasions, when infinitely
higher matters&mdash;matters of eternal interest&mdash;than mere music
and pictures, should engage the attention of dogs. Bearing in
mind that pictures should be an aid to religion&mdash;not a substitute
&mdash;let us put some of our best pictures on loan; nice soul-uplifting,
truly sanctified pictures, such as ‘Little Samuel’s Waking,’
‘Daniel in the Lion’s Den,’ ‘the Prodigal’s Return,’ etc.,
etc. Such pictures as these fill the mind with pure and holy
thoughts, and when properly administered will, without interfering
with their more imperative duty of attending church, do
them a great amount of good. Of course I do not mean that
we should throw open these our precious treasures of art without
restriction, to the gaze and handling of the whole breed of
dogs without distinction. Oh, no, the dogs must be made to
recognize that these are <i>our pictures</i>, and that their owners
have rights to be protected. We must duly impress upon these
dogs’ minds that ‘<i>It is of grace, not of debt</i>’ that they look upon
them. We must impress upon them that we, the fleas, so loved
the world of dogs that we gave the loan of our art treasures,
that whosoever would might look upon them, and be a better
and more contented dog. Well, not exactly ‘whosoever’; it
stands to sense that we must exclude all dirty dogs, for some of
<i>us</i> will be there sometimes; and we must exclude dogs with
sore eyes and bad breath, as we should not like any of our
refined lady visitors to be offended by such unwholesomenesses;
and it will certainly not do to let in profane and vulgar dogs,
as bad manners corrupt the pious dogs. And as for those
dogs who have been known to express subversive sentiments&mdash;sentiments
inimical to fleas&mdash;that would lead to the overthrow
of the present divinely appointed order of things, why, they must
not be admitted at any price or on any pretense. All others
should be allowed, if properly provided with an admission
ticket and vouched for by two respectable members of flea
society. With these trifling but judicious exceptions and
restrictions, I think pictures may, under the divine blessing, be
made an incalculably blessed means to the uplifting of poor, sinful
and fallen caninity.”</p>

<p>This big bug of a barker sat down amid thunders of applause.
And the President, rising, advanced to the front of the platform,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 248]</span>

and when the applause had abated, said, in a voice of
emotion: “Friends, Heaven does, indeed, bless us, for as I stand
here I see that one whom we all love and revere has just
entered the doorway. [Here the whole assembly turned
to see who it was, and broke again into rapturous vociferation
on beholding enter the very Honorable and Holy One a Maker
of long prayers and short wages]. We have with us <i>our beloved
John</i>, rich, pious, patriotic, humble, holy, and altogether
lovely, and I shall have the exalted pleasure of asking him to
address us now.”</p>

<p>THE Honorable and Holy One a Maker was in especially good fettle
to-day. To his usual rotundity of paunch and rubicundity and sleekness
of visage, the warmth of his complimentary-adjectived reception had
added a glow of self-complacency, which gave his countenance the
shine and sheen of transfiguration. Having dined well of this earth’s
bounties, and afterwards in silent communion quaffed deep quaffs
of the “Wine of Holiness” of the oldest and rarest vintage, he was
overflowingly full of beaming sanctimoniousness and charity, and his
seventh-day eye was more highly

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span>

enlarged and heavenward-lifted than usual; insomuch that all the lady
fleas were enraptured, and said he was an angel, and too beautiful for
anything, bless him.</p>

<p>In accents low and mellifluously cadent, he said: “Dear
friends: It would ill become me to attempt to emulate the
magnificent eloquence of the reverend barkers who have addressed
you. Unseen of you, I have heard their addresses, and
I trust I may be pardoned if I try to supplement their suggestions
by the suggestion that in our magnificent efforts for the
spiritual bettering of the canine race, we forget not their corporeal
needs.</p>

<p>“Oh, my friends, I mingle with dogs more, perhaps, than
any of ye, and my heart is torn and bleeds for their poverty
and sorrow and suffering, and I would suggest that we, who
have the means, do something for their corporeal wants. My
suggestion is that we do something larger in Charity for them.</p>

<p>“Oh, my friends, think of the great gifts Heaven has given
to us, and then think of the return we owe to Heaven for the
profitable use of them. As I tell the poor dogs in my blood
suckery and in my Sunday snivelling prayery, we ought to do
all we do to the glory of God; for, God, <i>He counts all our
actions</i>.</p>

<p>“Now, my friends, I tell you Charity is the finest investment
ye can go in for. It yields the largest dividends. Not only do
we please God by it, and so secure mansions and harps and
crowns above, which will come in very handy, when we can
make no more out of this world, but by giving much in Charity
to these dogs, we win their affection and their veneration, and
by soothing their stomachs a little, we soothe their restlessness
and their inclinations to sedition, and so preserve them in a
meek, pious and subservient frame of mind which is conducive
to low wages. Thus you see, my friends, a large Charity fund
is putting wealth <i>where it will do the most good</i>.”</p>

<p>Great applause greeted this suggestion of the Honorable One
a Maker of long prayers and short wages, as he resumed his seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>Then there arose, with great diffidence, a very elegant lady
flea. She was the consort of one of the Monstrous Fleas, Lady
Vanderbillion Flea by name, and with much modesty spake
thus:</p>

<p>“Most honorable assembly of fleas: the suggestion of the
very Holy One a Maker of long prayers, touched my heart.
The word Charity is the most holy and tender one in all our
language. It is a grace peculiarly feminine, and it has been
reserved by God to lady fleas, as their highest prerogative, to
give it its proper expression, and I would modestly suggest that
all the lady fleas here present give shape and form to the Charity
which our dear brother has, in the fullness of his heart, recommended.</p>

<p>“I have an idea; I believe it is an inspiration from God:
Why not get up a Charity Ball of the Fleas for the dogs’ benefit?</p>

<p>“Now, we all have one great gift; we are all <i>great on the
hop</i>, both male and female. Then why not sanctify this gift by
arraying ourselves in our very best, and, putting on our bravest
and most gorgeous panoply of gold and silver, and our most
resplendent gems, to the sound of the psaltery, cornet, harp,
sackbut, dulcimer and all kinds of music, make a grand hop,
and let the proceeds thereof go for the founding of a hospital
for the care of broken-down dogs?”</p>

<p>Here the speaker was interrupted by applause from all the
lady fleas, and tumultuous ejaculations of “Good, good,”
“Splendid,” “Oh, wouldn’t that be just lovely!” “Oh, oh, a
grand dressing and hop for Charity.”</p>

<p>But the Honorable One a Maker arose and said it was perhaps
a very good suggestion; but as dancing was to him not
the highest form of piety, and as he always made it a practice
never to keep any but the very best quality of goods in his
stock of piety, he would have to decline to be a contributing
party to the matter, but if the ladies present thought that the
Ball could be so managed as to be unobjectionable from a religious

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 252]</span>

point of view, and to advertise <i>his</i> name abroad to the
world, he would esteem it a favor.</p>

<p>Lady Vanderbillion Flea, resuming, said: “I am proud to
see my humble suggestion so well received. Oh, my dear fellow
godly ones, ye know that we dearly love to hop; we dearly
love to bedeck ourselves in gorgeous ornaments, and we dearly
love to be seen one of another in all our glory; and I suggest
that all this love of legitimate display, this beautiful amusement
of ours, which has hitherto been only a pastime, be for the
future put to some holy use and profit.</p>

<p>“Let us bring our whole selves and our amusements as a
precious gift, and lay it as a sacrifice on the altar. Let us sanctify
ourselves wholly in the sight of Heaven. Let us prayerfully
and with a contrite heart put upon us our most costly and
resplendent raiment. Let us, with reverence and all humility,
and in the fear of God, fetch out our bushels of diamonds and
rubies and pearls and corals and sapphires and amethysts and
topazes and chalcedonies; our leagues of golden chains, and
piles of bracelets, wristlets, anklets, tiaras and coronets, and in
our most gorgeous equipages, attended by our troops of lackeys,
flunkeys, lickspittles and slaves, repair to some magnificent
and brilliantly appointed hall, and there let us hop with a
holy hop unto the glory of God and the honor of Charity, pure
and holy, meek and lowly, chief of all the graces three. Thus,
my friends, shall we combine our own enjoyment and the benefit
of the poor dogs. And the Great Gee Whizz, the Many
Headed Daily Press, will be there, and will write it all down to
tell it all abroad for the amusement and edification of the dogs;
and next morning our left hands shall know all that our right
hands have done, and the whole world shall know how we
‘Danced for Sweet Charity,’ and how the ladies looked and
what each one wore, and all about it.</p>

<p>“Oh, my friends, how sweet is the contemplation of the
blessedness of helping God’s poor, of doing good, and in our
humble way, helping to bring in the Kingdom of God. But,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 253]</span>

above all, we shall have the blissful assurance in our hearts
that we are pleasing God; for we have the word of Scripture
for it that they who give to the poor lend to the Lord; and the
Lord is in great need of loans just now. And think what a
comfort it will be in our dying hour, that for one poor night’s
sacrifice for His poor, we shall have an eternity of reward.</p>

<p>“Of course there will be no dogs admitted, for the admission
fee to see us hop will be so high that none but the rich will be
able to afford it; but as the proceeds are to go to the dogs, this
will be a blessing rather than otherwise. And of course, too, to
admit a lot of unkempt, musty and ill-smelling dogs would
mar the harmonies of the picture; would not consort with the
brilliance and beauty of our paraphernalia, and would offend
the delicate sensibilities of our sister saints. They would assuredly
keep away the very rich and &aelig;sthetic elite, whom we wish
to come to see us hop. In fact, deeply and intensely as I love
the poor, <i>in their proper sphere</i>, I should not care to come myself.</p>

<p>“This, my friends, is my suggestion; and I think that with
charity balls and picture galleries, and free music, and free gospel,
the problem of canine discontent and infidelity and poverty
will be pretty nearly solved. And I think too, that if the
dogs are not thankful for all this great provision that we have
made for their temporal and eternal welfare, they are a most
ungrateful set.”</p>

<p>SCARCELY had the air, agitated with the acclamations
following Lady Vanderbillion Flea’s happy
suggestion, recovered its tranquillity, when a large
flea was seen to enter by a side door, near the
platform, and, in evident agitation, present a little
note to the presiding angel of the assembly, His
Grace, the Serene and Excessively Distinguished
Archiepiscopus of the Diocese of Puliciania, who, as he perused,
was noticed to turn very pale and shake, while all the fleas
looked on with nervous apprehension. He had scarcely finished,
when he beckoned to some of the most eminent,
wealthy and Monstrous Fleas to come with him into a corner,
as he had a matter of vital import to speak to them about.</p>

<p>Whereupon, the assembly of the fleas, always apprehensive
of trouble, could not contain themselves, but cried out to
know what was the matter. So, His Grace, the Serene, etc.,
etc., in faltering accents made answer and said: “Alas,
Brethren and Sisters, this messenger hath brought us evil
tidings of great grief. He reports that a most virulent, infectious

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 255]</span>

and contagious epidemic of the thinking disease has
broken out amongst the dogs, infinitely worse than anything
heretofore known; yea, so virulent is it that it seems to defy
all the remedies known to the Bamboozlers’ Pharmacop&oelig;ia,
which, with God’s help, were always until now so efficient.
So violent and rapid is this plague, this messenger says, that
the victim seems to be taken utterly without warning. One
minute, he is, to all appearances, in the very best and most
satisfactory state of idiocy and drivelling devotion to Country
and Flag, and the next, he is in the throes of the most dreadful
and dangerous sanity. He says the Board of Public Safety, the
Bamboozling Committee and the Great Many Headed Daily
Press, have been hastily summoned, but are gaping at each
other in dumb and helpless bemuddlement; and all the Emdees
are in consultation, but are quite puzzled, for they never knew
or heard of such a sudden and widespread outbreak. He says
they say they think it is the recurrence of an old, and supposed-to-have-been-extinct
disease&mdash;but which evidently travels in an
elliptical orbit of such immense elongation, that its point of
intersection with the orbit of canine revolution gives the disease
about an every-ten-centuries periodicity of conjunction.</p>

<p>“He says they say it is a disease that attacks the optic nerve
of each eye simultaneously, and is caused by the abnormal
intensification and &aelig;sthetization of the anonymous gastric
thingumybob, at its point of junction with the visual organs,
and is primarily due to intense and prolonged hunger and
abuse. This disease is known in common language as “Eye-opening,”
and is regarded as a very fatal malady; not, singular
to say, to the dog attacked, but only to the fleas on him, as he
immediately begins to sever those sacred relations which God
has established between him and his fleas, so that they begin to
wither and perish for lack of nourishment.”</p>

<p>And at these ominous words, great fear and trembling came
upon all the assembly, and they began to bewail, and to charge
that an ungrateful Providence had gone back on them, in the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 256]</span>

very hour when they had gathered to do something to help him
in his work of blessing the dogs; and they grew bitter in denouncing
Pup McPoodle as an incompetent and unfaithful Executive,
and the Boards of Public Health and Safety as a lot of
antiquated old duffers, and the Bamboozling Committee as a lot
of noodles, and not half as smart as they were cracked up to be,
and the Great Many Headed Daily Press, as a fraud and a
false prophet, and everybody and everything else, for betraying
them.</p>

<p>And when His Grace, the Serene, etc., etc., proposed that
they sing a Hymn of Faith and put their trust in Heaven, they
gruffly replied that Hymns of Faith were utterly inadequate as
compensation for the utter loss of dogs to bleed, and as for putting
trust in Heaven, that was all very well, provided one was
on the spot to look after things. And when Tee de Little Wit
Blatherskite arose, and, with idiotically histrionic gestures, began
to vociferate that in vision he saw the Lord as a man of war,
coming with chariots of fire, lightning, thunderbolt and tempest,
to the rescue of His Anointed and the discomfiture of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 257]</span>

infidel and irreligious dogs, they rudely told him he was a bag
of windy words, whose fine God didn’t even deliver <i>him</i> in his
hour of need; for when he fell once, lately, into a hundred-foot
debt hole, his fellow dogs had to fill up seventy-seven
hundredths of it, before he could scramble out.</p>

<p>And at the very height of this confusion, a great commotion occurred
amongst those near the door, and a Big Dog, followed by a whole troop
of dogs, boldly entered. “What impudence!” said some of the highly
perfumed and delicate lady fleas. “What a disagreeable smell of dog,”
said others. The Charity-Ball enthusiasts, at sight of the dirty mob,
fainted dead away; the fattest of the salaried barkers sneaked out by
the side door; while the eminent, wealthy and Monstrous Fleas, to hide
their terror, grew truculent and made a great hubbub and threatening;
but the Big Dog in a voice of thunder, bade them be silent. The
terror-stricken fleas fell flat, and the Big Dog advancing, extended his
huge paw, and thus addressed them: “Listen, most eminent and respectable
representatives of the most eminent and respectable order of pimps,
barnacles and blood-suckers; I and my gang of fellow-sufferers have been
at the door of your convention for some time past, and we have heard all
your elaborate schemes which you have concocted for our welfare.</p>

</div>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>“About the time you fat, full-blooded and comfortable suckers called
this convention to take into consideration

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 258]</span>

the miserable condition of us dogs, a number of us dogs had the (to
you) sublime impudence to call a convention to take into consideration
_our own_ condition; and we pride ourselves that we have reached a far
broader and more practical conclusion than your worshipful body has come
to. As you well know, there has been brewing amongst us a very deep
discontent with our condition, and a very decided conviction that we
knew exactly what was the matter with us, and how to mend it.</p>

<p>“Some of us had fathers who could remember the honored
chieftain, Bull McMastiff, and the good times dogs had then,
and they told us that old Mastiff used daily to say and repeat:
“My dear dogs, beware of the fleas,” and he prophesied that so
surely as they abated their hatred of fleas, they would sink into
poverty, meagreness and misery.</p>

<p>“And so it has been. When Bull McMastiff gave up the
ghost, McPoodle, a bad-for-everything ruler, who, like most
other beastly pests and nuisances, has lived to a most unconscionably
great age, relaxed the stringency of our laws, and allowed
the missionaries of the fleas to settle amongst us, and these
missionaries went about amongst us preaching that McMastiff
was an imbecile old fool, who did not know what was good for
dogs; that the fleas were a much maligned and misrepresented
class; that a few fleas&mdash;a nice judicious selection&mdash;on a dog, were
not only no detriment, but a positive advantage to him; that
they helped his general and particular health; that they purified
a dog’s blood, and enriched it with certain valuable elements,
which all truly healthy dogs need, and that the few
drops of blood they took as dividend, were a mere nothing in
comparison to the service they rendered, that they could assure
them that no dog could be said to be really and truly healthy and
complete without at least <i>some</i> fleas upon him; yea, they went
so far as to declare by Heaven and Holy Scripture, that fleas
were <i>divinely appointed</i> to give life and joy and peace to dogs,
and that the race of dogs would die off the face of the earth, if
it were not for them; and they told of very many terrible instances

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 259]</span>

where whole nations of dogs had utterly perished for
want of a few fleas.</p>

<p>“And we dogs were idiots enough to believe the pious lies they told
us, and we allowed you to become a part of our community; and, very
soon, it fell out that <i>ye</i> became the real, actual community, and <i>we</i>
became your feeders, your providers, your most humble and obedient
servants. We took you to our bodies and very soon ye made them your
own, and, puffed up with pride, ye came to imagine that ye only were
the people, <i>ye</i> were the republic; <i>ye</i> called yourselves on all
occasions, ‘the country,’ ‘the nation.’ <i>Ye</i> made war and peace, and did
everything and got everything but <i>the fighting and the paying</i>. <i>Ye</i>
got up centennials, bi, tri and quadri, of this, that and the other,
which <i>we</i> poor starving dogs were bled to pay for and allowed to look
at from a great distance. And the overgrown suckers of other nations
sent their ‘greetings’ to you; and when they, to vary the monotony of
their centennials and anniversaries of this, that and the other, got up
a grand Jubilee Jamboree to commemorate the fiftieth year of the efforts
of a fat and fuzzy old lady sucker, Queen flea of Kyhidom, and her
prolific brood to bleed <i>their</i> dogs to death, <i>ye</i> sent your greetings
and prayers for God Almighty’s blessings on their efforts; and all this
pious snobbery and robbery and jobbery, ye called ‘<i>drawing closer the
bonds of international comity</i>.’</p>

</div>

<p>“But us dogs, whom ye condescendingly permit to pay for
all this, and allow to look at the glory of afar off, whom ye permit
to read of the forty-course banquets ye feast at <i>in our name</i>,
ye taught that we owed our very life to you, and that it was our
duty to give up our daily blood to you, and give thanks to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 260]</span>

Almighty God that He had in boundless mercy so bountifully
blessed us with fleas. And we dogs did so deeply fall into the
idiocy and supineness generated by immemorial usage and
custom, that we came to regard this division of us into masses
and classes, sucked and suckers, robbed and robbers, workers
and idlers, starved and overfed, as of natural order and divine
appointment.</p>

<p>“That is, most of us did. There were a few who refused to
wag the adulatory tail of approval of this system. We ceased
not to howl and bark day and night our discontent. And for
this ye called in dogs of Belial to witness against some of us, saying,
they did blaspheme God and the Law, and then ye carried
them forth and stoned them with stones, or hanged them with
ropes till they died. And ye threw mud at us in the name
of the Lord, and went and told the hungriest and leanest and
foolishest dogs amongst us that we were ‘Socialists,’ ‘Seditionists,’
and ‘Anarchists;’ and they, not knowing in their heart
what those words meant, did therefore hound us and mob us
and persecute us for endeavoring to restore to them the liberty
they had lost. Oh, they accused us of disturbing their rest;
of trying to make them discontented; of imperilling their
positions with their natural superiors, the fleas; of trying to
subvert the natural order of suckers and sucked, and of trying
to bring on the day of judgment and the destruction of the universe.
Poor fools!</p>

<p>“But one day, two or three of the hungriest of us wandered
away out of town, and lay down under a tree in a solitary place
to think and weep out the sadness of our hearts; and as we wept
and meditated, behold an Angel appeared unto us and saluted
us. And we, shaking with terror, said, ‘Who art thou?’ and
he said, ‘I am Plain Common Sense, the rarest Angel of all
that visit the earth; Heaven hath appointed me Messenger-in-Particular
to the hungriest of the hungry.</p>

<p>“‘I never visit fleas, and seldom do I come to fat and comfortable
dogs. I am a lonely Angel, and I have a tremendously

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 261]</span>

long beat to patrol, which I cannot, even if I make haste, complete
in less than ten hundred years; therefore, ye are very
lucky in being here just as I was passing. But whosoever
entertaineth me receiveth always a blessing.’</p>

<p>“So saying, he drew from a pocket in his toga, a little phial
containing a thin and colorless fluid, and bidding us hold up
our faces, he, with his finger, moistened our eyes with the fluid.
Instantly, our eyes were endowed with a marvellous seeing
power, and our brains seemed to be filled with lightning flashes.
‘See ye any better now?’ said he. ‘Infinitely,’ said we; ‘why,
we see what a lot of unspeakable idiots, and wooden-headed
fools we are, not to have seen what a lot of utterly useless,
superfluous and ruinously exhausting fleas we have been carrying
all these years.’ ‘Just so,’ said the Angel. ‘Now, take this
phial, and what hungry dog’s eyes soever ye shall moisten with
the fluid, shall instantly receive power to see through a ladder.’</p>

<p>“We thanked him, and implored him to tarry with us and
abide and take something; but he was grieved, and said he was
no police dog, and had several stars to visit before midnight.
And he vanished from our sight.</p>

<p>“So we took the little phial, which was labelled, ‘Dilute
Solution of Plain Common Sense; one drop, applied to the eyes
of a very hungry dog, warranted to make him see through a
flea,’ and tried it on every hungry dog we met; and the result
was, as the Angel foretold, that every one was instantly restored
to the most exalted sanity, and saw clear through the humbug
of the whole dirty useless gang of you, your Bamboozling Committee,
your Flags, Statues, and lying Patriotism, your blasphemy
of Liberty, and cant of Freedom, and everything else
that there is of you.</p>

<p>“All these dogs with me have had their eyes touched with
the Solution, and the epidemic, as your fool Bamboozlers and
Emdees call it, has run through three-fourths of Canisville, and
the country roundabout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>“Now, therefore, we have come hither to propose a new
<i>modus vivendi</i>, some way of living without <i>you</i>; but before we
do that we desire to express to you our gratitude for all the kind
things you have done and have this night proposed to do.</p>

<p>“We thank you for having sent us the Gospel of Earthly
Contentment and Future Reward. As ye were the first, efficient
and only cause of our discontent, the robbers of all our means
of growth, physical comfort and intelligence, ye owed us something
as a set-off; but seeing that ye offered us only a very far
distant and uncertain intangibility of future recompense&mdash;<i>that
ye yourselves had no power to grant</i>&mdash;while what ye took from
us by FRAUD and <i>mental chloroforming</i> was something real,
actual and of present tangible value, we have decided not to
accept your promissory note that is to be redeemed <i>some indefinite
time in next eternity</i>. We believe that <span class="smcap">NOW</span> is the
accepted time for those who toil to get their reward, and that
NOW is the accepted time for all idlers and suckers to starve to
death. We believe that it is blasphemy to neglect the earth
that IS for a heaven that <span class="smcap">MAY BE</span>.</p>

<p>“We believe that God is the God of <span class="smcap">JUSTICE</span> and that he has
punished us for doing ourselves <i>the injustice of being robbed</i>,
and for doing you the unkindness and injustice of helping you
to live in demoralizing idleness on unearned wealth.</p>

<p>“Therefore, out of pure love for ourselves, and a consuming
<i>anxiety for your welfare</i>, we will take the full reward of our
labor NOW, and turn over to you all the hopes and realities of
future reward and glory which ye make so much of. Ye have
taught us the ineffable blessedness of poverty and trust in God;
of empty bellies and the contemplation of other-world bliss.</p>

<p>“Therefore, be it enacted, and it is hereby enacted, by us
dogs now restored to our senses, that from the passage of this
Act, i.e. <span class="smcap">NOW</span>, ye fleas, suckers, robbers and poisoners, shall
have all your privileges as idle drags upon our prosperity taken
away from you, and ye shall henceforth be endowed and crowned
with all those sacred and inalienable rights to starve and die,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span>

to sink or swim, which are now the great and particular endowment
of dogs throughout the world.</p>

<p>“But in lieu thereof, and as a set-off, we make over to you in
fee simple, and to your heirs and assigns forever, all those
mansions in the sky, and the grounds thereto appertaining;
all those sweet fields of Eden and the sweet rest to be found
there; all those harps and crowns of gold, the robes and palms
and glories and pleasures forever more, and all the sweetness
and light and satisfaction, etc., etc., etc. These we give, grant
and convey to you in the same disinterested spirit as that in
which you bequeathed them to us.</p>

<p>“Go, then, in peace, and, rich in all the wealth of <i>future
hope</i>, may you be happy. Heretofore, ye have taken our earthly
things and pretended to give us in exchange heavenly things.
We will now re-exchange them, and while ye are enjoying the
strange new bliss of <i>earning</i> your earthly things, so there is
nothing to prevent <i>us</i>, while enjoying our earthly rights, from
looking forward to the good things of the future.”</p>

<p>And the fleas, at the pronunciation of this sentence, fell into a
grievous terror, and bewailed the hard fate that had overtaken
them; and said that life without wealth and leisure would be but
penal servitude; and none of them seemed to take any comfort
in this Heavenly Inheritance. Yea, some of them, at this reversal
of fortune, went insane, and many of them saying, that if
a “title clear to mansions in the skies” was all that was left of
the wreck of their fortunes, they might as well be dead, took
one tremendous jump and went out and drowned themselves.</p>

<p>BUT in spite of the consternation amongst the fleas,
the big dog remorselessly continued: “Furthermore,

OF THE PRODUCTS OF OTHERS’ INDUSTRY</span>; ye
thieves, hear me! Ye have broken down the natural and just

extremes we made to meet and form a sickening spectacle for
High Heaven to spue over. We flattered you, we worshipped,
praised, lauded and magnified you. We made you our gods,
and taught ourselves to shake and tremble in the unapproachable
light and glory of your infinite divinity. And ye were but

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Oh, the infinite marvel of it! that the world of dogs should
ever have gone so blind, imbecile and demented as to have
lifted you dirty pests into the throne of the world, and made
you the lords of all power and might. How many million yards
of the sackcloth, and tons of the ashes of repentance will this,
our mighty sin, need for its expiation! Dogs, dogs, that we
were ever to have done it! But we did it; and for our reward
ye drove us, ye bled us, ye tortured us, ye killed us and made
merry over our corpses. Oh, shame and everlasting contempt
be on us that we&mdash;without whose permission ye never could
have existed one minute&mdash;should, in our fathomless stupidity,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 266]</span>

have created you, and then have abdicated the throne of our
sovereignty and put you despicable, infinitesimal cusses into it!</p>

<p>“This was our sin; and ye, our creation, have been our just
punishment. This is always Heaven’s judgment on those who
sin against themselves by giving up their self respect, and surrendering
their natural rights. We reap as we have sowed. We
stripped ourselves of our God-given and inalienable rights to
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&mdash;things that were
<span class="smcap">NOT OURS To GIVE AWAY</span>&mdash;and sinfully gave them over to you,
and lo! ye were the very ones who mocked and scourged our
nakedness. We became your slaves and <i>thereby gave you the
right to despise us</i>. We invested you with the whip and the
spur, and thereby invested you with the right to drive us to the
devil. And ye <i>have</i> driven us to the devil. And we have had
the added misery of seeing you trying to amuse us while driving
us there.</p>

<p>“Ye stole all we had, and when thousands of us died of want
your compassion was touched, and ye sent down for our relief
quite a lot of good things, accompanied by tracts and choice extracts
of Scripture, and a few requests that we be thankful and
love the givers. But some of us, nosing amongst these gifts,
recognized them as the same ones ye had stolen from us; and
while the poor fools amongst us were trotting around thankfully
licking their chops, and wagging their little tails, and tearfully
and prayerfully invoking God’s choicest blessings upon you, we
walked off disgusted that there should live fools so God-forsaken
as to be thankful for the return of a crumb from the thief who
stole his loaf. <i>Ye</i> called it CHARITY, and the poor fools sent
up a request to God to remember you in love for it. <i>We</i> called
it the small articles the thief is obliged to drop because Nemesis
is after him; and we prayed God to send a time when we could
remember you&mdash;WITH AN EXTINGUISHER.</p>

<p>“And this time has come now. We came here and heard you devising
new schemes to divert us from our discontent. Ye knew that discontent
is the precursor of investigation and the knowledge of what is amiss.
We heard you propose everything but the only thing needful, viz: TO
GET OFF OUR BACKS. Ye would make us believe that ye sought OUR GOOD;
but the real motive of your conduct was YOUR OWN SAFETY. Your blood
sucking franchise being your very life, ye could not, of course, think
of giving it up; so ye proposed to throw a meatless bone to the dogs
in the shape of Free Gospel, Free Music, Free Pictures and CHARITY
BALLS&mdash;which are nothing less than a damnable endeavor to palm off
on God and us your love of display and riotous pleasure as CHARITY. Ye
<i>must</i> have your hops anyhow. Ye <i>must</i> have your ostentatious displays
of pride and property, and your nights of dissipation; but the happy
thought struck you that you might kill two birds with one stone, and
have your unrestricted, selfish, fleshly pleasures, and by garbing them
in the disguise of Charity, get also by means of them into Heaven’s good
book. But we have found you out, and concluded that if we have our own
freedom we can get our own gospel and music and pictures and do our own
dancing.</p>

<p>“Therefore, we, in our plenary power to enforce this decision,
do enact that <i>we will do without fleas</i>, and we do hereby resume
the control of our own bodies; and therewith we resume all our
self-alienated rights and powers; and at the same time we give,
grant and convey to you, for your behoof and benefit, all that
gospel, that music and those pictures ye have provided for us.
We shall not need them now; ye may, for, lo! your doom is
sealed.”</p>

<p>“What doom? What dog insolence is this?” cried one of
the eminent fleas, in a bold tone. “Dost thou not know, dog,
that this is sedition, anarchy and a breach of the peace? Begone!
thou and thy low-born, dirty and ill-smelling crew, or by the
Law we will turn you over to the police dogs.” And all the
other fleas, plucking up heart at these words, cried out too;
“Yes, begone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>But the dogs laughed, and their leader said: “The day of
dogs’ obedience to the commands of fleas is gone. Said I not
unto you that their eyes had been moistened with the Dilute
Solution of Common Sense, and that they can now see through
fleas? Ye have not heard; but I and these my fellow dogs
were commissioned by the other dogs of Canisville to come here
and tell you that a new Will of the Dogs Expresser hath been
set up, a very much bigger, better and more effective one than
that which ye commanded your slaves and imported beasts to
destroy and burn with fire. This Expresser hath the novel but
righteous provision for <i>dogs</i> to sit at the bottom of the shute
thereof and <i>do the counting</i>. This hath been set up in the
Public Place and all the dogs have this day dropped their little
wills into the slot thereof, and when the trap in the bottom was
pulled and the wills were counted it was found that there was a
Great Majority, and the Great Majority said that both the
fraudulent Nighuntos and the swindling Faraways should get
away from the Tank, that the Blood and Bones Mill should be
broken down and the Handle sold to the devil; that the lying
Bamboozling Committee and the Great Many Headed Daily
Press should be branded as frauds, and that all dogs, big, little
and whatsoever, should be absolutely forbidden to contribute in
any degree to the maintenance of fleas, and any dog found
guilty of having the smallest flea on him should be treated as a
public enemy and driven out of the city into the wilderness.</p>

<p>“The police dogs, alarmed at this universal coming of the
dogs to their senses, have retired to their kennels, to watch the
weathercock, and some very impulsive ones, being quite confident
that the dogs are now on top, have very ostentatiously
clubbed several eminent fleas; and the Bamboozlers and the
Monstrous Fleas, after calling in vain on the prudent and non-committal
police dogs to club back to slavery the newly self-enfranchised
dogs, have run away. Bones and meat are coming
out of their hiding places, and flesh is beginning to grow over
the poor dogs’ bones; and we are here to tell you to depart

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 270]</span>

peaceably and find some other community of fools to live on, or
live on one another, we care not which.”</p>

<p>But the fleas flew into a great rage, and cried out: “To Hades
with your infernal Expresser! Fleas always have been on top,
and will be forever!” and, yelling “Down with Sedition,” they
with one accord jumped upon the backs of the dogs, and knowing
it was now a case of victory or death, they beset them sorely,
saying they would teach the miserable, thankless curs who was
master. There were many fleas to each dog, and they were
very fierce and savage, but not a dog whined or scratched. With
tail erect and a noble light in his intelligent eye, the leader
turned and departed, followed in like manner by all the others.
They passed a place where a lot of timber had been cut and
each seized a big chip in his mouth as he trotted along. Soon
they came to where flowed a considerable stream of water, on
the bank of which they formed <i>in reverse order</i>. Then, with
tails trailed in the very dust, and to the murmuring music of the
moving waters, they waded in backwards as far as they could
until nothing but the chips and the very tip of each nose was
above the water. This caused the fleas to drop all thoughts but
those of self-preservation, and in a scrambling panic they
scampered from dry point to dry point till the chip was the
only resting place for their feet. Then, holding each nose upright
and each chip well aloft, each dog sank, until nothing but
the chip, black with a cursing mob of outwitted and dethroned
blood-suckers, was to be seen above the water. A moment more
and each dog let go his chip and came to the surface a little way
up stream, giving the widest possible berth to any chips floating
away from his fellow dogs. Farther up the stream they took
to the banks, on which they gathered together and from which
they exhorted the drowning fleas to practice the virtue of content,
and to look above to that Heaven to which they had so
often pointed the dogs. But as the mob of erstwhile powerful
tyrants floated away into the dim, forgotten Past, there came
for answer only a wail of despair and a dying prayer that God

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 271]</span>

would avenge them some day on a wicked and thankless race
of dogs. The dogs, however, with humble and contrite hearts,
burst forth into a dog song of deliverance, which ran:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Sound the loud timbrel o’er Misery’s dark sea,</div>
    <div class="verse">The Suckers are gone, the enslaved ones are free;</div>
    <div class="verse">Their power and their pride are gone down in the wave,</div>
    <div class="verse">And the curse is removed, of Master and slave.</div>
   </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And the dogs with songs and joy marched back to the city,
and Pup McPoodle and all his gang of wicked and cowardly
courtier dogs, hearing of their coming, were seized with terror,
and “put” with such rapidity that the momentum of their going
carried them far out of sight, and it is supposed they are going
still.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_271.jpg" alt="Illustration: PORTRAIT OF THE BIG DOG RETRIEVER." width="200" height="270" />
</div>

<p>And the free and happy dogs called the Big Dog Retriever,
“for,” said they, “he hath retrieved our lost prosperity,” and
they cried aloud that he be elected chief; but the Big Dog would
not consent, and he said unto them: “No; I
will not be your chief. Be ye your own chief;
let this, for the future, be a government of the
dogs, by the dogs, and for the dogs; delegate
not your power to anyone, be he never so wise
and good, for the dogs that do that commit
treason against themselves, and if their chief
sell them to the fleas, they are but justly punished,
as ye have been by Pup McPoodle.” And all the dogs,
having still the influence of the Dilute Solution in their eyes,
cried out with one accord: “That is Plain Common Sense; <i>we</i>
will be the government, and no one shall have the power.”</p>

<p>And it was so. And they set up and kept up all the year
round a great, big, free Will of the Dogs Expresser, and through
it they passed a law that whatsoever law should henceforth be
made should be <i>ratified by the dogs</i> through the Will Expresser.
And it was so. And all laws whatsoever which they had <i>were</i>
ratified through it and without its ratification was no law made
that was made. And their laws were very few and very good;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 272]</span>

for they found that the wisdom of <i>all</i> the dogs was greater than
the wisdom of any one dog or of any few dogs; and there being
very few laws, they were simple and easy to understand, for the
object sought thereby was Justice and not to fatten fleas.</p>

<p>They also made what they called a Constitution&mdash;a Solemn
League and Covenant&mdash;which they ratified seven times through
the Will Expresser, that provided that fleas and suckers of any
description should be regarded as Unconstitutional insects, to
be arrested on sight and driven ignominiously out of town, and
that any law to allow them an existence amongst dogs should
be Unconstitutional, and that any dog who should ever propose
such a law should be declared a traitor to the community, and
condemned to abide by himself in the wilderness, and that any
dog who even spoke with any favor of fleas should be deemed
insane and be locked up out of sight.</p>

<p>So peace, good order and freedom abounded, and with these
came more to eat than they ever needed.</p>

<p>And having true Freedom in the land they pulled down the
Liberty Bell, and the grotesque copper Lie that disfigured the
prospect at the gates of the city, and broke them both up for
old junk, for they said they could not endure the sight of emblems
that were lies when they were put up, and only reminded
them of the days when they were bamboozled and cheated; and
anyway, they said, real true Freedom was <i>seen</i> and <i>felt</i> everywhere,
and needed no clangor of metal to proclaim its existence;
for a Freedom that needed such an infernal din and racket and
oratory and show to make itself known was evidently <i>not self-evident</i>.</p>

<p>And as for the old Flag of the Free, they hardly knew what
to do with it. Some said that the fleas and the Bamboozlers
had made such a lie of it, had so blasphemed Liberty in its name,
and had so defiled it by hoisting it over so many damnable and
bloody iniquities that, really, the only proper thing to do was to
burn it and devise a new one. But some said that as it was
originally devised by fairly honest dogs who had had no education

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 273]</span>

concerning and experience with fleas, such as the expensive
and terrible one they had just gone through, they thought if
the old Flag were well fumigated to take away the sickening
smell of fleas that clung to it, and were well scrubbed and
scoured, and had all the dirt washed out of it, it would do very
well. So they cleansed and purified it, and set it up; and under
it they lived perfectly happy ever after.</p>
